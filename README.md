# project sentiment

**My goal is to create an effective sentiment analysis data product that will assist businesses with identifying areas for growth in customer service by identifying trends in review data**

_-Sentiment analysis is the practice of using algorithms to classify various samples of related text into overall positive and negative categories._

## tools of sentiment analysis

    - "tokenizing": split up text by word or by sentence. This will allow you to work with smaller pieces of text that are still relatively coherent and meaningful even outside of the context of the rest of the text.

    - "filtering stop words": words that you want to ignore, so you filter them out of your text when you’re processing it. Very common words like 'in', 'is', and 'an' are often used as stop words since they don’t add a lot of meaning to a text in and of themselves.

    - "stemming": a text processing task in which you reduce words to their root, which is the core part of a word. For example, the words “helping” and “helper” share the root “help.”

    - "tagging parts of speech (pos tagging)": is the task of labeling the words in your text according to their part of speech

    - "using a concordance": see each time a word is used, along with its immediate context. This can give you a peek into how a word is being used at the sentence level and what words are used with it.

    - "making a frequency distribution": check which words show up most frequently in your text

    - "finding collocations": A collocation is a sequence of words that shows up often.

## NTLK package

- The NLTK library contains various utilities that allow you to effectively manipulate and analyze linguistic data. Among its advanced features are **text classifiers** that you can use for many kinds of classification, including sentiment analysis.
