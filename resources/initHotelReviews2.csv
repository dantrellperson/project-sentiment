920524964_1723996,"Clean, good location Clean, good location with many restaurants, shopping near.  Rooms are small, suggest requesting double beds for extra room.  A/C did not cool well.  Trash bins in lobby and out front overflowing/nasty.  I would give 3.5 if an option.",10/9/23
923539768_23228472,"If only they fixed the windows The entire staff was very nice and the front desk did a great job trying to accommodate me, but the hotel has a noise problem. I moved 3 different times. The windows are not double pained and are ill fitting, so no matter which way you face or which floor you are on, there is no escape from the intense street noise and the motor bikes and sirens are disruptive. Heavy drapes would help, but they only have a single blind and a wispy voile curtain.
Interior noise is also an issue: you hear door slamming and hallway chatter from guests and cleaning crew. And since this hotel caters to a lot of weddings, this proved problematic. They gave me a sound machine but it was like an airplane turbine and proved worse.

The bathrooms were nice but I thought the rooms were lackluster. Based on the fact the hotel is an architectural gem, I had high hopes. Sadly, my sleepless nights mean I won't be returning. The downstairs bar was lively. The gym was nice but unfortunately it is windowless.",10/29/23
890353761_4232666,"Stay farther away from Zion Below what I expected for the very high price but I assume that's because location. My digital key didn't work for the outside door to hotel so had to get plastic key cards; hotel staff said the Hilton app is glitchy like that. Also a parking pass from front desk is required so why advertise contactless check-in? The a/c was too cold when running and too hot when not running no matter what temp we set so kept waking at night to reset. The water pressure was poor, the towels were rough. I understand why they use the large pump bottles for shampoo, conditioner, lotion and hand soap but I don't think it's very sanitary and the products inside the bottles were not quality. Breakfast was typical. Glad they only clean rooms on request during a stay. Good location to catch the Springdale shuttle but it would have been better to stay outside of Springdale and park in one of the many paid spots available instead.",5/14/23
893575470_96805,"No Windows Hotel was fine, but will never stay here again to the rooms not having windows to the outside. The air sounded like a generator was running every time it kicked on. Staff was great and it was clean. I would have no complaints if the hotel had windows and a quieter a/c.",6/5/23
885090446_4946937,"Hyatt Place Omaha Old Market needs a refresh The staff seemed attentive and willing to help. However, the Hyatt Place Omaha Old Market needs a refresh, it's old and outdated. The price point is high but the property needs help. The carpet transition from carpet to tile in the room is shredded and coming apart. We had connecting rooms with one having an issue with the A/C. Thankfully upon calling for help the maintenance team remedied by changing out the unit and the issue was resolved. I was hoping for a higher level experience given the price point.",4/6/23
882342635_240165,"Spring Break Miami My girlfriend and I came for a Spring Break trip. The hotel was very accommodating, with great facilities and upkeep. Aaron was especially helpful, with great recommendations and overall service! Highly recommend!",3/15/23
921026648_7890891,"No Parking!! This place is a ok place, but staff are rude.  And no parking.  I have a Handicap placard and 2 people in our party that cannot walk very far.  We was told at check in that anyone with out a visible placard for the hotel would be towed.   there is 5 cars and one in a HC space with no placards at all, and they will not tow them.  Had to park a block away. Front desk guy just laughed when I explained about Handicap.  Also cleaning staff are loud in the mornings. Laughing and to the point of waking up the whole hall.  Will never stay again here or recommend it to anyone",10/12/23
874803862_84122,"A great visit Abdul was helpful and kind.  The Madison is a great place and wonderful food and service.   We had a dinner in the hotel restaurant.  Great environment, minimal crowds. We had a great experience.  Thanks Abdul!  The rooms at this hotel are also comfortable and spacious.",1/11/23
890511151_111371,"A little worn, but lot's of charm Beautiful older hotel with lots of character. Charming marble lobby and the hotel restaurant, Livingstone's, felt like a time machine back to the era when travel was still chic! I was upgraded to a suite, which was nice, but the room needed a reno (and an upgrade to better coffee in-room please!). The security latch on the door had been broken off, holes in some furniture, etc. I was on business and spent little time in the room, so no worries for me, but was a little disappointed after the luxury of the downstairs. All in all, was glad I stayed there.",5/15/23

Hotel is lovely and clean and plenty to do  around the hotel too!",10/22/23
929222572_84360,Pool and Beach Access Closed They didn’t tell us until 5 days after booking that the pool and beach access was closed due to the hurricanes of 2022.  Our room smelled like a dirty dog. But otherwise the staff was friendly and the breakfast was good.,12/11/23
928741001_87736,"VERY LOUD/ HOT ROOM/ WINDOWS DO NOT OPEN  IMPORTANT DETAIL: Thermostat doesn't seem to adjust down (I was trying to get my room a little cooler - down to 67, but it wouldn't cool off with fan on 24/7 and thermostat set to 65) and WINDOWS DO NOT OPEN AT ALL.  Breakfast was good, Serve Staff at Jaxx was great.  Angelo was Awesome.  
Very disappointed in the lack of addressing the noise complaints for the night of Nov 30 when the RAVENS 'Pre-teen Girls Hockey Team moved in.  Screaming, slamming doors, running up and down the hallways until after 11PM was unacceptable.  I called the front desk and they already knew which group of girls  I was referring to and said they would send someone up...  2 hours past and it never got any quieter.  3 of the 4 nights were pretty good with exception for the temperature",12/7/23
880217434_1382467,"Don’t give them your credit card The accommodation was fine. However, a $50 preauthorisation was taken on Feb 10 and has still not been returned to my bank account by Feb 26. I had a VERY rude reply by the night staff member through my hotels.com message facility and the hotels.com rep who called them also said they were very rude. I wish the manager would make sure payments are returned straight away. There is a definite training need for staff. If the manager sees this please would they leave an email address for me to contact them on? Given the above, I would not recommend this hotel.",2/26/23
900446408_181946,"Atrocious hotel. The water pressure in the shower was down to a trickle, unbelievably annoying. No windows no ventilation. It’s like staying in a cage. The mattress was soft and soggy and caving in the middle. The manager in charge should be ashamed to let the hotel run with such low quality. Shame on you, Hyatt.",7/4/23
868121477_242220,"The pictures don't tell the truth. The walls are bare, the lighting is cheap. We travel through RCI to have the best experience, yet this experience was the worst. The staff here knows nothing about a partnership with RCI, which makes me question RCI's credibility. We expected beautiful accommodations to celebrate our anniversary. We considered checking out and going to another hotel but we made the best of it.",11/12/22
926820522_1699819,"Won't be back  Could not get our EV charged. Extremely loud music until 2am both nights. Very noisy trash collections each morning at 6:30am. Room was extremely small, and did not have any place to sit except on the bed. Beach was noisy with construction. Bartender at Naked Taco was rude. Breakfast was supposed to be included, but they insisted on charging us extra $7 for bacon. No water in room. No available ice.",11/21/23
926111984_8643156,"Great Stay!!! Our experience here was excellent! It started when we walked in the door and weee greeted by Mark..what a welcoming delightful young man. So important for first impression. Room was spacious and clean, quiet and comfortable. Breakfast was great….fresh fruit, hot bacon and eggs, lots if bread choices, cereal, juices, yogurt, etc etc. only 1 drawback of entire stay was water pressure and accessibility…shower took some adjusting and sink taps were very weak but not bade enough to change an overall stellar rating",11/16/23
916774510_99455,BEAUTIFULLY SPECTACULAR My stay at the HYATT Regency by the riverwalk/riverfront was amazing! It was peaceful and relaxing. The accommodations of the room was stellar. I enjoyed the bed and the bath/shower; I appreciated the welcoming.,9/16/23
893942551_96468,"Keep your money!! I was highly disappointed about my stay. The rooms look way more outdated in person than they do in the pictures. We had a king suite and the sheets were too small for the bed. We requested new sheets, but no one ever brought them. All night long, for FOUR nights, I was constantly readjusting my sheet so that I didn’t up sleeping on a bare hotel mattress. A main reason thaf I selected this hotel was for the pool. It was absolutely filthy and deplorable. There were rocks, bird poo, insects, you name it floating around the pool. Even in the indoor pool! I didn’t feel comfortable letting my daughter swim in it at all. She was extremely disappointed to say the least, we stayed on the 4th floor and the hallway had some kind of awful stench. The room also triggered me husband and I’s allergies. I was thoroughly disappointed with my stay considering the fact that it is under the Marriott Bonvoy umbrella. 

The one positive was the kindness of all the employees. I had frozen breastmilk  with me but the rooms didn’t have freezers. They took my bag of milk and put it inside their freezer for my stay. I am very grateful.",6/7/23
880404169_14416950,Great stay The accommodations were above expectationsStaff was friendly the room and the hotel were clean and no foul “hotel “ odors. Breakfast was a full breakfast with plenty of fresh food and coffee This location will be our go to when staying in RI,2/27/23

871499727_110795,"Dated and Broken The property is from the 1970s it has one elevator. It was broken the entire stay. We were on the 4th floor. One of us needed a ground floor room for accessibility. Hotel did not offer any thing but ""oh, sorry"".
The rooms are decent sized, the bathroom was clean but small. The water pressure was not existent. 
If you show up with low expectations this may barely meet them.",12/12/22
866553903_817538,Maurice and Alisha Friendly and funny staff and great accommodations! Enjoyed my stay! Would definitely stay here again and recommend staying here. Plenty of places to eat near the area. Maintenance guy Mr. Edgar was a funny man.,10/30/22
885639308_457118,"Convenient accommodations in Berkshires  Great staff, very friendly and helpful. My room was nicely appointed, clean and comfortable. The hotel was near to attractions in Great Barrington (just outside of town), which made it easy to pop into town, or access other area attractions.",4/10/23
881711998_281611,"Best service in town! You can find a few places that charge less, but you won't find a hotel that has better service!  I've stayed here a few times over the past few years and always have been pleased with service and accommodations from check in to departure.  Bonus is the Carousel just a 2 minute walk away, and the BrewHouse next to the Carousel.  Looking forward to my next visit.",3/10/23
880869768_1500362,"Going downhill!! We have stayed at this property many times in the past and thoroughly enjoyed it but stayed in Jan 2023 and March 2023 and it was horrible. We stayed in a King Suite I. The 2nd floor that had been ""renovated"" they said. It was NOT renovated in any way. Filthy..old paint..old bathroom..the head of the bed was 6"" lower than the foot.. very uncomfortable...bathroom tile grouting was awful..filthy entryway I wiped up with a washcloth..disgusting HVAC vents..bathroom ceiling vent (didn't work)  If there was a highlight it would be the breakfast room. New flooring and tables/chairs. Old paint on the walls and old drapes. Great hostess though. We've decided this was our last time. The elevators were scary. We took the steps and all the hallways and stairways were littered  with all sorts of debre. A GOOD cleaning would make a world of difference. Sad to see the decline.",3/3/23
917834423_123556,Vacation We had a very good experience with the staff. The hotel services and accommodations were excellent. We got upgraded to a better room and it had a balcony overlooking the river.  Excellent service. Thank you!,9/22/23
894418617_238137,"June 2023 This hotel is only good for one night before flying out. The mattress was hard and the bed was low. The air conditioner was also very loud. There is no Resturant on site or anything in close proximity. We ordered food on uber eats and it took forever to arrive. Breakfast was ok and basic. They had eggs, toast, oatmeal, sausage and fruits. The Eggs were powered. The oatmeal was good. It’s something to put in your belly before an early flight out. We reserved the shuttle to the airport and as we were boarding, we were stopped and offered a free taxi to the airport. When I asked why, I was told because there was a large party with kids that needed the space although they never reserved a spot. Why is that my problem? But it worked out in our favor to get dropped directly to our terminal with no extra stops as the traffic to the airport was a bit congested. Overall it was a decent one night stay. I Don’t think I would stay here again. Felt more like a motel than a Marriott.",6/11/23

No reimbursement for damages, not even Hyatt points.",11/27/23
919950509_573347,"Expensive The additional fees for parking, added room charge and activities were ridiculously high. To zipline for a family of four alone was $600.00. The self parking was $18.00/day and the valet parking was $40.00/day.  The signage was bad.

893455222_82324,"Never here again...... We have stayed at Best Western hotels for years.  In general, we have always had pretty good experiences.  Until this hotel.  The outside looks reasonably good.  Inside things need upgrades; carpet, tubs, plumbing, etc.  
The person who checked us in was much more interested in who or what she had going on with her phone.  The office chair in the room was so wobbly, I thought it would dump me in the floor.  The tub/shower was extremely dated.....in need of upgrades.  We will continue to favor BW hotels in the future, but never this one again.",6/4/23

There is no full breakfast, but a bag with water, a muffin and a yogurt. Property is centrally located and rooms are good and lobby is decent. It’s a shame they don’t attend to these important issues!",3/12/23
928778700_92703,"Arizona Bound We have stayed here before on numerous occasions. This time, the quality seemed to have slipped a bit.  Our room had no LED bulbs in the bedside lamp. Obviously, the previous customer took them, which is a sad testament to human behavior, but I would have thought that the cleaning staff would have identified this to maintenance.  The top of the cabinet was sticky, which seemed to be due to a soda can or similar. Easy to miss, and easy for us to clean, but obviously not checked. The heater fan was very noisy, so we left it off overnight. The room could use some minor repair.  We slept well and the breakfast was very good. We would stay here again.",12/7/23

862585171_14103163,"Check-In was Painfully Slow We were a tour group travelling Canada from the UK. We had travelled for hours in a coach from Montreal and we arrived and stood in reception for approximately 40 minutes while the staff on the desk laboriously input all our details to enable us to have our room keys. Very poor management of staff as while the junior staff (thought to be new) on reception input the details while what were thought to be supervisors watched and did nothing to help or support them. As guests we were shocked to have to endure all this - WHY WERE THE BOOKINGS NOT COMPLETED IN ADVANCE OF OUR ARRIVAL LIKE THE PREVIOUS HOTELS? Not a good start to our stay and thoroughly annoyed all the guests from the group waiting. Stars marked down due to this.

892658247_10000104,"False advertising, misleading descriptions The BW website advertises a 2 room family suite with 1 king and a pull-out sofa, 1 king suite. The pictures for the listing show a king bed in the main room with the pull-out sofa. In reality, there is only a single king bed in the suite and no bed in the main room. This foiled our plan to put our toddler in the suite and shut the door while mom and dad slept in the main room with the newborn who wakes up every 2 hours to nurse. Instead, we shut ourselves in the suite so we could have a bed while our toddler slept in the main room blocking us from the bathroom, room exit, and sitting area once he was down for the night. Wish my wife could have used the sitting area to nurse.. We drove out of our way to stay here based on the advertised room availability.

864540711_100056,"Great Food at The Junction, Lovely staff!  Let me start with the positives. The Junction is phenomenal! The grounds were beautiful but not as large as we expected. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. 
Now for a few things we were not as happy with during our stay. We drove almost 1600 miles to this destination (my first time to Vermont) for our fall road trip to find no robes, and a room that needed some updates (especially for the price). We ate at The Tavern the first night, it was not good and it was almost $100 for pub food. We couldn’t get reservations for the cooking class, over 3 weeks out, but we decided to come anyway. We wanted a little more interactivity at The Junction (as advertised), but again the food, service,  and ambience were incredible. If it weren’t for The Junction, this review would have been a 2.5. 
We will return to Vermont, not sure we will stay at Essex, but will revisit The Junction and hopefully a cooking class.",10/14/22

The hotel is tucked away in a quiet area surrounded by pine trees m, aspen trees and overlooking mountains. The lounge has a wonderful collection of Kachinas on display and Rachel was a very attentive server. We ate dinner in the steakhouse and Alfredo was an excellent server. He constantly check to see if we needed anything and let us know that our order was coming out shortly. They separated our dinner onto two plates, which was very nice. The shrimp cocktail was so fresh and enjoyable and so was the French onion soup. We shared a 14 oz ribeye, which was nicely seasoned and cooked perfectly. We had a very comfortable king handicapped room with a roll in shower. There was a computer desk as well as a cabinet for the refrigerator, coffee maker and glasses.

The valet was very expensive and I had to  walk to the back of the hotel to find it.   There were no hooks in the bathroom for towels, or makeup bags. Finally there was no security on the elevators.

I particularly like the big windows. I left something in the room, and only discovered it on my return. I tried to contact the hotel by email and then by phone, only to get a loop of choices that went nowhere. I called many times, and got no answer.

Hotel is still operating under Covid restrictions with no room housekeeping.  We were told to put our used towels in the hall laundry chute and our garbage outside our door. We then had to get our fresh towels, etc at front desk. This is basically a serve yourself hotel.  Be aware, there is fairly noisy construction going on outside the hotel all day long, which is not mentioned on their website or when calling for a reservation. 
We had a 1 BR suite with a kitchenette.  There were a few dishes and pans, but no cooking utensils.

I contacted the front desk, told them about the bugs, and asked for another room. Later, I was told that they were looking for another room, but all the rooms were booked; and they were looking to see if there were any cancellations. I ended up staying in the room with a family member.  

The next morning, my family and I told the housekeeper about the bugs in the room. She told us that  it happens all the time. That's still no excuse.  At check out, I explained the situation again and asked for my money back. Needless to say, I received a reimbursement.

We stayed in tower 2 on the fourth floor. Rooms were clean, beds were very comfy, AC was cold. It was nice to have a mini fridge in the room.

Walking distance to little Italy and the port. 

The not so good was The balcony was very small, high parking fee and water 
pressure was weak. 

Oh and the smell of the hotel lobby smelled exactly like my favorite rose perfume, heavenly!! 

I would return back to Wyndham bayside",7/31/23
925052210_84095,"Convenient Parking for Nearby Studio Theater Generally speaking, I have parking karma, but there are parts of the city where karma of any sort doesn't apply, and one of them is the area near the Studio Theater.  So as to ensure that we'd have a space within 3-4 blocks our show, my wife reserved a spot in the lot of the nearby Washington Plaza Hotel.  It was just $11 she was able to organize the entire thing online.  No fuss, no muss.  The only hitch we ran into was opaque instructions for how to use and then discard the card the front desk gives you to open the gate upon departure: we had to go back to the front desk and get the help of a bellhop.  Otherwise, the PERFECT way to organize parking in a difficult area of the city.",11/8/23
916116649_225691,"A poor choice for the area Pretty disappointed in this Comfort Inn. 

There are always 3-4 strange men lurking around the entrance, chain smoking and talking on the phone in foreign languages. Stayed here on two separate occasions within the same week and they were there every time I came to or left the hotel. Not the same men, but always hanging about whether 8:00am or 10:00pm. The cigarette smoke was obnoxious and I think single women would be very intimidated and uncomfortable staying at this hotel.

The carpets in all three rooms I saw were very filthy and your bare feet immediately got dirty walking on the carpet after taking a shower.

TVs are old and very small.

Toilets are very low.

Tub/Showers are very tight with a soap dish in the corner on the shower head side that you couldn’t help bump with your elbow when washing or rinsing your hair.

No maid service at all.

Very pricey for the location and all of the above.

Many choices in the immediate vicinity so I’d never choose this one again.",9/11/23

She went above and beyond her role and I’m my time, really gave the Sheraton the 5 star review- Mrs Debbie was just as awesome with running interference and making sure things went well for all their residing guests, KD took care of us inside at the bar- the first night and while the restaurant lagged on food service times- the portebello fries- out this works-  the beds could use some mattress toppers for those as myself not tolerating a very FIRM mattress , the down pillows were almost too soft and went flat- however, quick fix with their diff style pillows overall sleep experience wasn’t the best but the atmosphere and the TOP-Notch 5 star service from Tabitha made up for it all!!!

If I were to describe this hotel in two words it would be modern and efficient. The hotel lobby is not typical, it’s a place to do your checkin.  While the rooms are small and have the IKEA feel they make up for it with being very clean and efficient. The designers have provided all the essentials in the room, nothing more and nothing less. I particularly liked the hardwood flooring and the hooks all around the room. The shower and the water pressure is just amazing. The mattress and the pillows were very comfortable. The hotel bar is chic and spacious with plenty of lounge seating throughout and a number of large TVs showing sports. We also visited the magic rooftop but did not find it very special, the crowd was very young and did not feel like a rooftop with the glass enclosures all around.

What made our stay even more special was the gracious hospitality we received from Eddie at the front desk during our checkin. He made us feel very welcome and provided us with a great deal of information about the hotel services and the nearby attractions.

The decor is fresh, new and has a sexy vibe.  The entire place is breathtaking.  The food quality and service are just as exceptional.  We've had great experiences at all Secrets, but this one is a level up.

Only compliant was about check-in.  We were granted a free upgrade (benefit of UVC membership) but were almost conned into taking a tropical view swim-out vs. our oceanview suite.  He pulled up the resort website to show us photos and the website had that room listed as $408 per night vs. the $435 per night our room was listed as.  When we pointed that out, we were told the website is wrong and they emailed corporate a few times already to have it fixed.  Bogus!! We asked for a manager and were told the same thing.  After additional hassle and unprofessionalism, we ultimately got our room (the one we booked and paid for) an hour and a half after the posted check-in time.

Attentive and extremely involved in communication with the client, the desire to recognize the mood of the client. It's so rare. I didn't quite like the unsmiling bartender, but it's quite possible that the person was just not in the high spirits that customers would like to see him. But this is exclusively my subjective vision. The hotel provides a very good set of services in the form of free sun beds, umbrellas, as well as free water to the beach or pool.

While we interacted with him a couple of times he was particularly helpful in making sure we got to JFK in time for our flight and took care of us in what could have been a stressful situation.  We would definitely stay here again.  

On the negative, the $35 mandatory fee is somewhat strange and not well explained.  The room while the core areas were clean, there were leftover cheerios in corner behind lamp.  I only noticed as I used an outlet back there.  Additionally when we had checked with other bellman prior to leaving on best way to get to airport they responded taxi's are impossible to get and pushed for us to book their car service (I assume they must get commission).

We booked months in advance and were placed on the 2nd floor in a handicap room. The room looked like it needed refreshing. The shower would spray out into the bathroom floor. I became good at building towel dams. It was noisy because outside our door was what appeared to be a maintenance storage area that was frequented by staff. It was a 2 star room. The rest (pool, staff, food) was 5 star. In the fall we might try another property for the first time in 8 yrs.",5/4/23

It is located minutes away from the Salt Shed, which is why I booked a room. The rooms are spacious and everyone I encountered was a pleasure.

When I checked in both Jatsiry and Alexa greeted me. They were very professional, polite, and personable. Jatsiry helped me when I had problems with my digital key and she didn’t make me feel incompetent. Alexa pointed out the Salt Shed, where I had a concert. She answered all of my questions, which was really helpful and I ended up walking back after the concert (a lot of people walked from the Salt Shed in the same direction). Also, Alexa recommended the peartini, which I had and enjoyed at the bar. The view was great and they had a couple of heated igloos that you could reserve and enjoy the view.

After I got back from my concert, Tony was at the desk and he too was very professional, polite, and personable.

Already booked for a concert in December and will book again for other future concerts at Salt Shed.

The lobby area is modern and there’s a water and coffee station and a few snacks. 
We received a note under our door saying we could choose a free gift and we chose the bottle of wine which was really nice. 
Our room room was on the 11th floor and was spacious and functional. It was quite clinically decorated and could do with a spruce up. The sliding wardrobe door didn’t work properly and it clearly hadn’t been decorated for some time. That said, the bed was comfy and the shower was old fashioned but good. The lights though….. they were really inadequate for the room.. so dark. 
We used the pool a few times which was really nice, good cocktails and a great view. Beds are not easy to come by but be patient, take a seat or cushion on the floor and people are leaving all of the time so it all seems to work. Lovely vibe up there.

There were so many activities for us to do that were kid and family friendly (there were two children with us) . My granddaughter loved the pool and my grandson loved that it was right on the beach! We were especially appreciative because Rita had no problem making sure there were locks on on our room door when we asked to ensure my grandson would not try to open them.

We used to stay here when it was a LaQuinta. Didn’t realize when we booked it that it was the same place. It’s been totally remodeled. 
Another thing important to me is safety. I always read reviews before booking. I’ve read many that warn of dark parking lots that get cars broken into at night. (I’ve learned to back the car in so they can’t just look in your back to see if it’s worth breaking and running) Parking lot we’ll lit. On a QUIET street, yet just off 75.

884151264_557223,Kinda Ify I would stay at this hotel again and give them another chance but the biggest issue needs to be fixed. The issue at hand is there was an ant infestation. There were ants everywhere. The room was very unclean. I didn't have a big problem with the ants until my partner and I had food and snacks for our stay and the ants infested all of it. That was very annoying because we had spent money and it was wasted. The TV quality was horrible and there was a light that didn't work. I did report the issue and nothing was done about it. With those 2 things nothing was a big deal but the ants is what really did it. I'm not sure if my partner and I were being dramatic and I know ants are natural and I understand accidents but this shouldn't be a problem that a hotel should have as they should keep up with the cleanliness of their establishment.,3/30/23
866603259_182012,"Excellent breakfast and large room  We enjoyed staying here and would do so again though there were some negatives, namely the Queen bed had a dip in the centre. As  there were 2 of us this did nothing to improve our sleep.
 The room was very stuffy on arrival, like it had not been used for ages. It was a good size and both room and bathroom were to a high standard, but the furniture had ledges with thick dust on them, unfortunately. The heating/cooling fan would not run continuously, and the window only opened a few inches (for security of children) so it stayed stuffy. 
The fridge had no freezer section, so we were unable to re freeze our freezies.
We needed the use of a microwave oven which limited our choice of rooms. 
Otherwise all was good especially the included breakfast which had all kinds of goodies all individually wrapped. On offer was an egg and cheese wrap, also wrapped. Orange juice in bottles too! Wow!  Staff were friendly. There is a good restaurant right next door to this hotel, which has a large menu at very reasonable prices, which we enjoyed.",10/30/22

Well how about the extremely uncomfortable beds and the pocket square pillows. In my room requests with Marriot it states feather free room with extra foam pillows. No extra pillows here as I sit at 1:55am and have to be up for a flight in 4 hrs. Have been tossing and turning for 5 hrs.

The only complaints I have about the room itself are 1) one of the towels had gray stains on it (hopefully stains and not fresh dirt) and 2) housekeeping needs to be instructed that the bathroom floor behind the toilet needs to be scrubbed now and then. 

I will say that some of the other guests were loud and obnoxious, carrying on conversations in the hallway rather than their rooms, and at least one room had a barking dog, but the hotel is not responsible for the bad manners and poor pet parenting of the guests.

No USB ports, and the actual electric plugs are on the lamps and it’s an odd placement so it was awkward putting in  my USB adapter. Not only did housekeeping take my towel, they took my plastic cup! Food is expensive and there aren’t many options nearby except a grocery store.

But the key is—road noise! Considering the location, it’s not surprising but if you’re a light sleeper, bring earplugs and white noise.",6/1/23

926795641_94665,"Mt. Pleasant quick stay It was a while since I last stayed here, so I figured I'd give it a try.  Unfortunately, some of the downsides I noted a few years ago remain.....most prominent the bed!  The bed was, in short, awful, and not the least bit comfortable.  The wi-fi also kept disconnecting in the middle of using, which was very frustrating (although the indicator was showing a strong signal).  And, one of my pet peeves...the shower-mounted toiletries.  I dislike these options, and case in point during this stay;  in the middle of her shower, my wife discovered the shampoo dispenser was empty when trying to use.  A call and a visit to the front desk took care of that, but that was about 10 minutes longer in the shower than she had planned, or wanted.

The complimentary hot breakfast was good, and the location very convenient for all of Mt. Pleasant's attractions and points of interest.",11/21/23

Luckily no such odor in the room itself but it did smell: dust, body odor/stinky feet/ wet dog is the only way I can describe it.  AC helped somewhat.  Hurried through breakfast the next morning due to mold -which I'm very sensitive to-permeating the entire first floor.  Despite the updated bathroom, this is an older hotel which I suspect was bought out by Hampton.  Oh, and the mattresses were horrible.  WIth two people, ours sagged in the middle.  I slept on an incline, kept rolling down towards the center, and woke up with a very rare backache.  Yellowed pillows.  Don't believe the positive reviews.

871206402_90478,"Stay elsewhere.  Don't waste your money. I have stayed here several times over the years, and the only reason I did so again was that I had surgery, and the location made things easier for my wife.
After arriving, we went straight to the executive lounge for a light snack and a glass of wine.  The lounge was still open for another 30 minutes. The lounge was unstaffed.  What food was left was a little bit of fried something and a cheap bottle of wine; we left.  The morning buffet breakfast was much better.

But the main reason for the low rating was the terrible bed and the need for the rooms to be refurbished.   The mattress was well-worn and lumpy.   Woke up with a sore body.  The rooms show a lot of use.  If this was a no-name hotel, then maybe ok, but this is a Marriott; as a consumer, you expect a certain level of quality in the brand.  The hotel is rated 27 on Trip Advisor because it earned the low rating.

Lobby was fairly busy when I walked in, but check-in was quick and smooth. Stayed in a high floor room with a king bed. The view from the room looked out onto the hotel parking garage, a nearby alley and some buildings in the distance. On the plus side, the windows faced away from the front of the building, so it was probably a little quieter on this side. The room was your typical Hyatt Place room, but for some reason it didn't felt as tired or dated as a Hyatt Place I stayed at previously. The bed was just as comfy, and I had no problems falling asleep.

The continental breakfast in the morning here also felt fuller here compared to the previous Hyatt Place.

However, I would not recommend the one-bedroom suites.  All of them feature a shower whose floor blends into the rest of the room.  And because there's no shower door nor a properly fitted curtain, water spreads throughout the washroom.

Every time someone showered, we had to mop the floor with towels.  We even spread towels before we stepped in, but water still sprayed all over.

Room was clean. Was a little musty when entered but fan use quickly remedied. Shower pressure was great and hot. Breakfast was adequate; no hot items provided but we knew that. Would be nice if they added cold hard boiled eggs to selection for protein source; did have peanut butter; can make hot oatmeal from packets. Staff were pleasant and responsive. Would stay again.

Overall, we were pretty pleased with our stay.  Our room actually had a nice view of the Delaware River.  Our room was large, and the bed was comfortable.  We also had both a comfy chair and a desk chair.  The carpets and the furniture were a little stained, but the bed and bathroom were clean.  We were given a handicapped room but didn't need it.

Every standard room has the two queens with bunk beds to sleep six easily. The beds are comfortable (really, the only thing that matters!), it’s clean, everything you’d expect from a Marriot. The ONLY issue I have, which I am able to overlook as I don’t have any medically diagnosed sensitivities, is they use an extremely potent air freshener or room deodorizer in the main entryway. I had no issues in our room or the halls. It was only while passing through the main entry and floor.  It didn’t seem to bother my family and I could just walk as fast as I could out, however, anyone with serious sensory issues to perfumes or smells might have more difficulties. I’ve given the five stars because the hotel and its staff absolutely deserve it, but feel it worth mentioning for families whose stay may be negatively affected by their experience entering and exiting the hotel.",10/6/23

The handicapped accessible room was easy to use and very close to ice machine and exits.  The breakfast was mostly the typical not very good eggs and sausage but the pumpkin waffles were tasty.  And there were other choices. Saw there was a pool and fitness area but we didn’t use them.

We opted not to have housekeeping as the hotel has a scheme whereby it donated a free meal to the homeless if you took part. It was fine although it would have been helpful if some cleaning materials were provided and bins emptied occasionally. We had plentiful coffee and water provided for the room, and we could get milk for the room fridge from the bar. We had a great view over the gaslamp area from our room.

The breakfast was not typical HH quality.  Same thing everyday.  Some form of simulation egg product that had no taste, it had chunks of squares in it.

Four hotels clustered in an industrial wasteland, and none of the others even have a restaurant. It's long hike (1 km) if you want something other than overpriced junk food to get to Tim Hortons - not something I was willing to do in the middle of the night on foot.

At this point I began to cry and my husband said we can not stay in this filth.
We loaded our luggage up and went turned in our key and lady said she would check us out. Never offered to refund us the money we paid for the horror show we had!

Rooms were spacious and nice. . … My lousy review is a reflection of the poor interaction I had with the hotel manager. I made an error and booked the wrong night for the hotel. I didn’t realize this until I arrived the following night, which I then had to book again. There is no question: this was MY error and the hotel policy allows  for a 100% no-show charge of one night. But as a loyal and long term a Marriott customer, I thought perhaps the General Manager would show some understanding and make some kind of accommodation. I know that this large hotel was nowhere near filled the night of my error, and that my vacant room cost the hotel nothing. It was dispiriting and maddening listening to the manager repeatedly say “That’s our policy. There is nothing I can do.”  Of course there are things she could do, if her focus was on the customer.

Oceana restaurant 

First evening
 Worst house wine of my life, and I am 60. 
Then, they say buy bottle of good wine!
Honestly 
Sell me a glass, because I think you have no taste for wine. But no option for that. 
I guess I know why. Maybe bad wone at high price. 
Nop
An entire bottle when your house wine you are proud of sucks?
Seriously?

No wine this week, at such a supposedly high end exclusive resort ´ to bad for for them. 

Very bad impression on first day. 

Also, grouper fish earthy taste. 

Food at Oceana

Squid missing the final grill time. 

Sea bass, fad, not enough salt, and I don’t like salt ( they did not know that).

After a rocky start regarding understanding the butler system and room amenities an upgrade took care of our needs. It was difficult getting someone to act on my request (a dozen requests).

Still please focus on this paragraph - once resolved the trip gave way to an exceptional time. Ronald - A diamond club manager stepped in to save the day. Our Butlers Olivia and Terrell were also helpful. The cabana experience was amazing!

To my foodie friends you MUST go to Grazie for not only the best food but exceptional staff! Most especially the breakfast staff that included Carla, Lea, Travis, Cheryl and Tanisha. These are the kind of people that take a vacation from amazing to memorable magic moments.

The rides around the hotel in electric cars with Daniel and Roberto were both fun and informative.

The hotel itself is gorgeous. The adult-only pool was our favorite spot to relax and enjoy the peace. It was just perfect for us to chill out. The beach house was another great place, offering stunning views and a cozy place to spend time.

The food was of good quality, plentiful and hot. the normal poor area is fine and very often our drinks were premium quality anyway. Evening entertainment really good. The coffee shop was great if you wanted a decent cup of tea (we’re English!!) Downsides  would be we would have liked a bit more ‘chill’ time round the pool when the music wasn’t so loud . I would suggest the roof top bar concentrate on the parting guests and their really loud music.The beach vendors were a tad tedious after a while. The non diamond beach section would have benefited from being laid out differently giving a bit more space. Felt on some days you had to chase and chase for an umbrella which could be frustrating .

I had such a great experience that I started to explore the KIMPTON brand nationally.  In December I made grace mistake and checked out Kimpton Banneker.  No restaurant for dinner on Sunday and Monday.  No bottle water unless you paid 6.  But this is the catch.  They charge approx 30 more for “resort fees”.   I couldn’t believe the GM in serious tone explained the reason for resort fees.  I told him I stay at IHG hotels 80 nights a year and asked what was different offerings from the standard KIMPTONS.  He couldn’t answer.  So if you want to be Nickle and dimed with limited hotel offerings stay there but I will never stay at another KIMPTON in DC except the GEORGE.  Thanks for the experience,12/8/22

I wasn’t worried, because we prepaid everything, including fees and resort fees before we even arrived. When it didn’t come, I called the hotel and was told the business office would be mailed to me as they charged me $280.00. I never received it. I contacted them through social media - Facebook messenger and no response. I still have no idea what I was charged for, but I should have disputed it with my card.

Yes I called out a couple staff members, but that will not change.  The management needs to know what is going on @ their property.  I hope they will take action to correct the problems here.  Disgusting, filthy, furniture that was unsafe to use or did not work at all, and staff that was combative and unwilling to provide their names for fear of a bad review and the truth.  Names of employees bring action which needs to happen more often especially @ this place.  Accountably brings much light to the table.

Note, while not the hotels fault, I accidentally booked the Fairfield Inn in Goshen, Indiana instead of Goshen, New York, and only realized it when I went to check in on the app. It sucks that Marriott couldn't do anything to rectify this (and seemed quite apathetic about it), and I did lose quite a bit of money as a result. So beware.",8/28/23

I showed the reservation confirmation but since the devil himself works for hotels.com they refused to help me. I then asked if I could book 2 other rooms, which they said they probably didn’t have. Once they actually looked, they had plenty of rooms…the customer service here isn’t just lacking, it’s non existent. The manager and assistant manager are rude, condescending and just lack people skills in general. I have booked rooms at this hotel twice, each time I called ahead to confirm and the person I talk to can’t take the 5 minutes to actually confirm my reservation, so both times there were HUGE issues. I book travel all the time and will never book with TRU again, it is the only hotel that gives so much grief when trying to check in!",10/10/23

Our room was really clean and we got our room cleaned regularly whilst being there and they did a really good job👌🏼 check in and out was really quick, we went during off peak season so the hotel was quiet and didn’t have to wait for elevators to and from lobby. They held our bags on last day as we wanted a few hours to explore before flying home and they were kept in a locked room with staff member at desk nearby.

My first impressions as I entered were not too great, but once we checked-in & used the room, it became apparent that it may not be a hotel for someone looking for 5star ambiance, but it certainly is for someone looking for location, practicality & comfort! Certainly will stay there again!

We were told this was for hygiene reasons. Hotel did provide mugs and glasses when requested. Our biggest concern was the hygiene of bed linen and duvet. Two flat sheets either side of an unprotected duvet. No seals at any end so when   You move around at night the sheets separate leaving a naked duvet against the body. Yuk !  How many other bodies have deposited who knows what on the unprotected and uncovered duvet.

We were originally told that our room was on the fifth floor, but the agent was nice enough to check to see if there was a room lower than that. The lowest they could find was a room on the 3rd floor. So, not knowing how long the elevators would be out of service, we had to make several trips up and down the stairs to get our luggage to our room. Turned out this only lasted an hour after we had everything in our room. 

Additionally, the only television channels that we could get for the first night were the local channels. Overall, though, the choice of channels was terrible, even with Tubi.

The casino is pretty much just a slot parlor from Sunday till Thursday as there are no longer live table games.

Their hot tub hasn't worked apparently in several years. When I received my bill, the parking and resort fee were higher than I was quoted. The dust on the surfaces in the room was easy to see. They don't clean rooms during the stay and you have to find the maid to get fresh towels. I used to be a platinum member but apparently throwing a couple grand no longer moves the needle much.  I guess my days as total rewards member have come to an end.  I'll stay at another casino property before I think to return to Harveys. Lastly, my room's wall was next to the elevator.

Contacted front desk and manager and took 7 hours to get a response. I actually stopped calling the front desk and found housekeeping in another room and she changed out the pillows but said someone else would need to do something about the ac vent. They send another person in later and he cleaned what he could but said that maintenance would need to remove and clean inside. We requested another room but the manager on duty was dealing with system related issues and said she would call us back. She stated that she would have to “have the room checked” to ensure it didn’t have the same problem. We decided to head to Target to purchase linen and cleaning products.

My room had a broken Soap dish and the shower was like a cave.  I went down for the breakfast and noticed that the Meat that they served was cold as well as the eggs.

Concerned by the complaints published here, I tried to get IHG to cancel our booking but IHG insisted that there was no flexibility in this matter. It was a mistake not to have consulted TripAdvisor first before selecting this hotel. For now, we can only keep fingers crossed for a decent stay.

IHG’s reply to me:

We are very sorry for the inconvenience. Your feedback is important to helping us improve our service. Upon checking, you booked at a restricted rate, which states ""Canceling your reservation or failing to arrive will result in forfeiture of your deposit. Taxes may apply. Failing to call or show before check-out time after the first night of a reservation will result in cancellation of the remainder of your reservation.” You may contact the hotel directly for further assistance with your reservation. We do hope you will give the hotel a chance for your stay. We will share your feedback with the hotel team for review.",2/17/23

The dresser they had the tv sitting on When u moved the drawers they would fall out.  The sofa  was wore out.  The blankets was put on the bed so tight they looked nice and flat. When you pull the blankets back there was a huge divot in the center of the bed couldn’t even sleep in the bed it was so bad  worst night I ever spent in a hotel.  Went up the next morning to the front desk Ask for a manager The man at the desk was reluctant to get a manager  Foundly said he would get a manager the lady that came out to the desk to talk to me wasn’t dressed as a manager  She was wearing a stitch shirt  not very professional at all for a Marriott hotel  I do not recommend staying in this hotel,2/7/23

One would expect USB charging ports on the nightstand lamps and bathroom lights that would not come on when required. The staff was extremely friendly and I made no mention of the issues except for the a/c which I mentioned when checking out.

 HI has not resumed in-room housekeeping services, so people leave bags of trash in the hallway for pick-up. Once in your room, it's fine: the beds are comfortable, the room is clean, the shower is good and hot, all the things I need from my hotel stay.

This was on the daily special menu, as well as the main course which they had run out of. So basically 2 of 3 items were not available; only the dessert was. Should have been massively discounted.

The walls were chipping, and the overall ambiance of the room was far from the standard I anticipated from a reputable hotel like DoubleTree.

To make matters worse, I was shocked to find that the duvets on the bed did not have duvet covers. This lack of basic cleanliness and hygiene standards is highly disappointing. Not only does it raise concerns about the overall cleanliness of the room, but it also significantly impacted my comfort and ability to relax during my stay.

The hall carpets are in not exactly great shape.  My air conditioner did not function properly which i indicated to the front desk around 6pm.  Suddenly, after 10pm, there is a knock at my door if it would be ok to try to fix it.  I was already half asleep and had a very important meeting the next day so I mentioned that it was way too late to fix it.  The night was uncomfortable but nothing I could do.  As a Marriott Ambassador, I expected an apology from the hotel which I never received (I was not looking for a free night, just an apology).  Breakfast service was slow and not great.

There was absolutely no hot water and when we went to the front desk to say something we were told that it depends on the time of day we used it because they only use one water heater for the ENTIRE building. Absolutely unacceptable and place should be shut down. Incompetent staff for sure one guy spent the entire time on his phone.

When my husband was going to take a shower before we left and noticed hair in the bathtub, a razor cover in the corner of the bathroom by the door and the towel he was going to use still had makeup stains on it.  He informed the front desk and was told that they needed to talk to the manager about these issues so they were not going to check us out from the room until then.  I had to call to make sure they did check us out and was told that they were going to talk to the owner about a possible discount on our bill (we were charged $134).

Very disappointed by the brand of the hotel.  Our bathroom was so small that the door didn’t even open all the way it banged into the toilet.  Rooms were not cleaned, had to request new towels daily,  on arrival the body wash in both rooms were empty had to request new ones. It did not matter of you called the front desk and asked for towels or body wash- no one delivers them you have to physically get them your self.  The elevators took forever as there was no service elevator and the staff occupied them with their large bins.  
I was surprised for an oceanfront hotel that they didn’t offer their brand name on bogey boards, umbrellas, chairs ect.  Missed marketing opportunity.  Bring all your stuff or buy them cheap somewhere else as you have to rent everything.  
The staff are all nice and there seems to be plenty however they appear to be badly managed.  Watched the cleaner for the lobby talk to all her comrades but ignore the empty plastic cups and garbage the needed to be picked up or swept.

Beds were very lumpy, and had some very noisy people on my floor and above me.  Needless to say not a good nights sleep.  Bathroom outlets were tripped and was super hard to reset. I know its a pet friendly hotel, but the smell was enough to gag.  Luckily I had just had my car washed, so I hung the air freshener from the curtain and turned on the fan!  The staff was great, very friendly,",10/19/22

The general manager is extremely rude and not helpful. 
Do not park with their valet - they will charge you $30 a night and then there is no attendant to actually get you your car, so they hand you your keys and send you across the street to find your car on the 5 level parking garage. We parked ourselves and paid $4 overnight.

Well they charged us anyways, and are refusing to refund our stay that we didn’t even stay there. Their ice machine was unhygenic , they had no scoop and had a broken styrofoam bowl on top to try to scoop ice.

Pros:  shower has strong water pressure

Cons:  room needs care (big crack on bathroom door, uncomfortable bed with black debris at foot of bed under cover sheet... asked for clean sheets and provided with 2 flat sheets, dirty shower, kitchen looks rough with all run down appliances), limited breakfast food (no scrambled eggs only boiled), expired yogurt by 1 week (didn't realize until I finished eating it), no waffles on weekends (this is not a Fairfield), located in an industrial park, noisy 95 traffic all night long, parking fee which is not included in the quoted price on line (sneaky) but if you scroll you'll see it on the website...on and on.

It seems like they have tried to update the room, but there are several things that are very old, mostly in the bathroom. Overall, it was ok. I probably wouldn’t choose to stay here again. I’d rather pay a little more for a nicer, quieter place.",6/29/23
885031788_254902,Not worth the money The room I stayed in was basically renovated but with the cheapest way possible of fixing things. One of the lamps was missing the screw which it wobbly. The bathroom tub was the absolute worst! Wha appeared to be a mat in the tub was a piece of plaster that was not secured. The tub felt like it was going to cave in if you moved under the shower head. The refrigerator was inside the closet in which I thought was odd. The towels had sticker briars on it which at the naked eye looked like a tick.,4/6/23
918016389_1546620,Do not recommend Do not recommend . The room was musty smelling and had a water stain on the  ceiling . Upon entry to the room the door key did not work . I also requested extra blankets and they marked them as delivered when in fact they were not delivered . I would not recommend this property and it is a disappointment to the Marriott name .,9/23/23
918861806_278220,"DON'T DO IT This place is gross and awful. Other areas of the hotel had bed bugs and roaches. Pool is neon green. Railings are falling apart. Leaking AC outside but also a leaking ceiling stemming from a light. The light switch itself was in the door frame. You can hear everything through the ceilings, next door, and outside. The elevator felt like it would collapse any second. We didn't get new towels during a 4 day stay and had 1 towel for 4 people. Horrible! Run!!",9/28/23

902471424_4946937,"Best Location in Old Market We were here for two weekend nights. This contemporary hotel is located right in the historic Old Market district, less than a block from the main commercial street. It's only a 1-10 minute walk from some of Omaha's top restaurants, as well as many diverse shops. It's right across the street from the famous (and huge) Hollywood Candy store. So you can't beat this location if you want to stay in the vibrant Old Market. But in addition to the great location, this is a really nice place to stay. Our two-queen room was on the top floor, with a nice view. The room was larger than you would expect, and included a spacious bathroom. 

Staff were friendly here. The free breakfast was standard for the chain, but well done, Parking is in a garage connected to the hotel, and is only $15/night. There is a small bar in the lobby, but it only serves beer and wine. Note that you have to specifically ask if you want daily cleaning. Overall, the location, quality of rooms, etc. here makes it a great place to stay in the Old Market. We were surprised at how good it was.",7/12/23
870573626_184243,"Middle ground location, don't expect parking when it fills up unexpectedly. Great price, nice rooms, and great location. The shower leaks all over the floor when you shower, and the coffee maker makes hot water well. You pay extra for parking, sure, fine until you pull in expecting parking and they say ""sorry it's full, We'll refund your parking"". No apologies, no warning upfront on checkin. So, had to find and pay for public parking overnight. Beware of shady front end staff.",12/3/22
894211929_84075,"Nice hotel in a good location We received a very nice room upgrade due to our membership status with their loyalty program. The room was very, very nice and well appointed. The A/C units were very loud though, so we turned them off when we were in the room (which we usually do anyway though, so didn’t disturb us too much). Other thing I would note is that the windows aren’t sound proof, so can get pretty noisy at night and early in the morning. The rooftop pool is nice to cool down after a long day out, but too small to swim. We also visited the Dovetail restaurant for brunch which was great, both in terms of food and service, but there were hardly any guests apart from us. Maybe not yet discovered by the crowds?",6/9/23

The bathroom could probably use some updates but overall everything worked for what we needed. However, around 9:30 PM the floor we were on, including our room, began to smell like weed and someone began playing loud music. Completely fine to have fun, but we had young kids who were trying to sleep. We didn't call the front desk, so it's very possible that they would've helped the issue. We turned the HVAC fan on and used a towel to block the space under the door. Without that the hotel would've been just fine. Breakfast was good!",6/19/23

The breakfast was fairly typical - scrambled eggs, sausage, and waffle machine.

I loved the friendly staff. Everyone we walked by greeted us with a smile. Also enjoyed the spa. It was VERY affordable and relaxing. The spa rooms and bathrooms could use an upgrade though. The vibe of the hotel feels like you are in the middle of the country, not 15 minutes from the airport. I felt safe walking around even at night. Close proximity to a grocery store and restaurants. Ubers were fairly cheap and comes quick. So glad I choose to stay here and not in the main city of San Jose.",5/26/23
928406652_72688,"Choose this one This place should be a Best Western Plus Plus, I don’t know what’s with their rating system. It’s a mature site with well updated large rooms, large clean windows, very clean and friendly. Breakfast was very good, crispy bacon with a cheesy herbed scramble and baked cinnamon rolls, and many side breakfast alternatives. 
Close to the highway, but quiet and nestled into a mature landscape. 
We had a king easy access unit, with roll in shower and a wet bar over the microwave and fridge and Keurig coffee maker by the second sink. Bed was great, came with 4 standard pillows, not the weenie little ones. Big windows with heavy drapes, standard motel a/c heat pump that was in good working order. 
Building entry features automatic opening large glass doors, door locks worked on the first try. 
Pool was closed for the winter, didn’t use exercise room or the WiFi as cell service was strong.

910820095_10255760,"Felt Like Home My wife & I stayed at this location 3 nights (August 9-12). This was a business trip for AUSA. The management and staff made it most enjoyable. The manager on duty was present when we checked in and was very friendly yet efficient. We were in our rooms comfortably before we knew it. Our room was clean and comfortable. The staff had the same friendly yet efficient demeanor as the manager, so I assume this is her training capability shining through. We were also impressed with the cook staff. Our breakfasts were hot and good. The cook and cooks staff acted as if they were the owners of a fine restaurant, as they greeted us and ask from time to time if we were happy with our food. There was one issue with the operation of our TV. I informed desk staff as I left for a 2-hour meeting. When we returned to our room the issue had been resolved. The location is perfect as its close to the Metro, and this enabled us to view a professional baseball game, as well as being close to many restaurants within a short walk.

Coming from the UK for a weeks stay I do not want to be making beds and cleaning bathrooms.

It seems to be happening more but there was no acknowledgement or thanking us for our honors status, but we were directed to where we could pickup out complimentary bottles of water. We used our $15 per person food and beverage credit at the restaurant/bar downstairs and it was well worth it. The Quesadilla was awesome, and Julie our bartender was also awesome. We stayed on the twelfth floor and the view was incredible, the room was spacious and modern, and most importantly clean. The hotel was a bit noisy during the night, but it did settle down later at night and wasn't too bad. We didn't stay for breakfast, and to be honest most hotel breakfast offerings are kind of meh these days, and Hilton have let us down more often than not with breakfasts.

The location cannot be beat.  Right on a Michigan avenue, it is an easy walk to the finest shopping venues and restaurants nearby.  Adjacent to the Chicago Tribune and the famous river, the Intercontinental is a great starting point to explore the magnificent architecture of the city.  The pool of hotel has been fully renovated to celebrate its storied past. The rooms have also been remodeled and are comfortable and clean.  I cannot praise the lobby staff enough.

As mentioned, the lobby area has renovations going on and this is not ideal but didn't impact our stay.  The rooms are a little noisy but you could not be more central.  I would give this hotel another go when it has more amenities.",7/18/23
888373348_98234,"Fabulous and Fun! We stayed for several days and had a wonderful experience. The hotel is gorgeous and the GM, Bill Simmons, treated us like VIPs. The staff was attentive to our every need. Though the hotel is under renovation, it was hardly noticeable and well separated from the rooms. The renovations preserve and honor the building’s railroad heritage as will planned enhancements in the future. Our room was newly renovated and fabulous. The rain forest walk-in shower in the bathroom was superb! We had a view overlooking Broadway and it was terrific for people watching. The hotel’s location is literally downtown. You can walk to everything from the Vanderbilt campus to the Schermerhorn Symphony Center and Bridgestone Arena. Would DEFINITELY stay again when visiting Nashville. I have stayed in many hotels in Nashville and the surrounding area and this was by far the most luxurious property of them all.",4/30/23

Yes, the hotel is a little outdated but the staff and our stay was pleasant.  We normally would stay at a Marriott or Intercontinental but got sick of the high prices.  Parking at the airport is crazy expensive if you are staying for any length of time.  They serve breakfast in the morning which is included but we decided to sleep in after returning late the night before.  We still were able to get a complimentary cup of coffee.  We had a 5:15 flight during one of the biggest snowstorms and requested a 3:00 a.m. pick up which was included in our stay.  No delays with the shuttle on both ends of our stay.

Room was again super clean and spacious. Free parking. 

We stayed during more strict Covid restrictions last year so the hotel was quite a bit busier this time around.  So we didn't have the entire pool and hottub to ourselves like last year.

893298955_90500,"The new parking system is not good.  I stay here once a year and I always like it.  However, they have changed the parking policy.  There is an adjacent parking ramp and you use to be able to rent a space at the front desk.  Now the hotel can only rent out a few parking spaces on the lower level.  

I said, but I know my slot number, can't you reserve that space for me?  

""No, the city prefers you to park on the lowest level.""

""I was just there, there are no spots on the lowest level.  Can I reserve the space I am in?""

""Well, the city prefers you to park on the lower level.""

""What does 'prefer' mean?  Will I be ticketed if I park somewhere else?

""Probably not, but I can't guarantee it.""

If you don't think this exchange is worthy of a four-star review instead of a five, then you have more patience than I do.

One other small note, the rooms are clean and well-furnished. However, there is not a single USB charging port in the room.",6/3/23

What I mostly really appreciated was that ALL the  staff is kind and smilling and that they really want to make you feel priviledge and welcome. 

The rooms are clean and correct, the beding and mattress is what we expect from a Hilton. 

The architecture is beautiful,  the beach is fine a little rocky, if you explore, there are other beaches around if this is your main activity. 
The resort activities are great, on time and perfect for everybody. 

I wanted to extend some special thanks to Juan the yoga teacher, Samantha Hildalgo for her attention and smile, Jesus Aguilar for making it possible to go on a tour in short delays. Victor and so many other waiters at the Spice who are kind and smilling. The food quality is great at all places throughout the resort.

Their could be an improvement in the house wine red and white. 

As for the rest, the location is great you can do in and out of the hotel feeling very secure to explore Playa Del Carmen which offers more than the 5th avenue.

The room was nice and cleaner than most.
Be advised: If you are staying multiple days, they do NOT do any daily servicing of the room. You will need to ask for anything you need (towels, coffee, etc.) They will not tell you this when you check in.

Airport transfers fine after some initial communication issues. You will  need  Whatsapp to communicate with the hotel ( common in South America)
This hotel  is not quite the standard of others I have used in the group, mainly due to;
No information documents in the room, e.g. how to set the room safe.
Only two coffee pods provided for the duration  of the stay. Extra can be purchased which seems poor service to my way of thinking. There is a machine in the lobby with a variety of coffee styles that I believe may be free??
The noise insulation from outside (traffic, planes) could have been  better.
The restaurant is quite good for dinner and excellent for breakfast. The dinner choices are limited but vegetarian and vegan options were available.
The pool area is fine given the hotel location in an industrial zone close to the airport.

Location is excellent - lots of good restaurants within a few blocks. The negative? The wifi is awful! I clocked 2 Mbps on Speedtest. I used my cell phone as a hotspot instead. I mentioned it at checkout, and they said they would flag my account to be put in a room with a better wifi signal next visit.

925407135_19901710,"Nice Hotel- Area is so-so Nice location across busy roadway to the beach.  No fault of the hotel but the homeless and lost souls that wander in the area, and sometimes into the lobby- could be cause for concern for young women or families.  Restaurant staff was very nice but service was slow (real slow) and food was ridiculously overpriced. Valet parking at $48 a night and a $43 resort fee almost has you at $100 bucks before paying for the room.  Hilton needs to buy the property next door and knock down that outdated complex so that you can at least have sunshine at the pool area in the afternoon (building actually cuts out sun from pool deck the entire afternoon.  Pool was COLD- could not believe it was not heated especially after some cool nights and considering it does not get any solar warming once building next door blocks the sun.  Rooms were very nice and housekeeping staff did a great job.  Front desk staff also very helpful.

While the room was nice enough and clean, the shuttle service to/from the airport is the worst. Going to airport, the shuttle was over 15 minutes late. Coming from the airport was a nightmare. The shuttle which is supposed to run every 30 minutes did not show up for over an hour and fifteen minutes. All the other hotels’ shuttles made at least 3 pickups while we waited over an hour and 15 minutes.  We were told that the hotel only has 1 van.

Our one issue was with the cablevision!!m  This had changed dramatically since we were there in 2022.  The remote was difficult, there was no index of stations and the quality of reception was poor.

Pros: The staff are the kindest, happiest and hardworking people you will ever meet. Resort is not large so no problems getting beach or pool chairs or cabanas.  Rooms are spacious and nice. Food in most restaurants is pretty good. Coffee is excellent. Selection of tropical fruits every morning great!! Our flight headed back out of MBJ was delayed by 17 hours so they let us stay an additional night using a ""distressed traveller rate""....not bad.
Cons: Restaurants are small so seating for larger groups is tough. Beach is small.  Some of the restaurants had food that was subpar(pierside).

The room was incredibly spacious and clean. It had a kitchenette which was so helpful as there is a supermarket nearby. While the bed was very comfy, the sleeper sofa wasn't super comfy. It is probably ok for kids, but not great for an adult.

Unfortunately, I didn't use any of the amenities, but there is a pool, restaurant (rated very highly), and spa treatments available. 

The location is excellent. It is very close to Disney World and they do offer a shuttle to various parks. I rented a car and we drove easily to the parks with little traffic. It is close to many restaurants and shopping for convenience.

The room itself was large (2 queen beds) and standard. Had to call the maintenance guy out twice as the A/C was not turning off but he sorted out the issue on the 2nd attempt. Breakfast was ok - waffles, eggs and the staple bread/bagels. Parking is charged at a daily rate but sometimes difficult to find a space at night.

It wasn't until AFTER the goods were already delivered that they sent us a receipt for over $1K, for something that costs $140 market value. We knew they would mark it up, but we didn't realize it would be by THAT much and felt like they deliberately left that information out of their response. When we tried to argue this, they said they ""were under the impression that we were aware of the pricing"", even though we have a paper trail where we asked them how much it would be.

There was NO manager on duty on a weeknight around 9pm and certainly no medic or first aid.

2. Charged 50$ more per night for the second person in the room claiming “this is how the order was placed with Booking “ ( was sorted out with the help of Booking, later)
3. Construction works prevented the possibility to rest . Drilling and hammering throughout the day. “We have no control on that” was the manager’s response.

The room itself was decently sized, however, corners were dirty. The room smelled like marijuana. We did get used to the smell fairly quickly, but the curtains, walls, etc all smelled. The only solution the person at the front desk offered was something to cover up the smell. :-( There was some sort of sports event in the area, so I do believe all of the room may have been full. 

The noise level was fine. I really didn't notice sounds from the hallway or other rooms. Another thing was the air conditioning didn't work quite right. We turned the fan on and AC down to 60^ and then walked out the door for dinner. When we returned, the fan was definitely off. The front desk person did come turn the unit off and on again.

I spend over 100 nights a year in a Marriott property why can I not just go to my room??  Grabbed snacks and soda from the pantry for next days drive, all were later found to be expired. 

Lastly, an individual was wandering around the halls who appeared to be drunk, while he could have been approached regarding why he continued  to wander the halls it was much more important to repeatedly ask me if my single night stay was business or pleasure.

We were put in a room at the end of the hall, cattycorner to the laundry room and next to the stairwell.  We were awakened throughout the night by what was likely the stairwell door.  Then to add insult to injury, the pillows were not comfortable and sleeping on them caused me to have a headache.  Otherwise, the room and hotel were clean and lovely.  Upon checking out, when I advised the front desk of the problems we encountered and they provided a 15% discount on the room; which was enough to pay the tax.

With them being loose it would be impossible to clean so god only knows how dirty it is. The comforter was covered in both stains and loose dirt particles. The bed skirt was wrinkled and looked as though it hadn’t been washed in months. Walls were covered in stains and dirt. There was food smeared into the ground on the hallway of the first floor for an entire day. The automatic front doors didn’t open or close so it had to be manually opened (which means our luggage cart BARELY fit through). The woman who checked me in was less than friendly.

1.  Room very clean. Everything working 
2.  We enjoyed the breakfast buffet. It’s included if you are Platinum but very reasonable price if you pay. Sheik was very sweet with our son. He helped him when I did not notice he was struggling with the bagel station,
3.  Every staff member said hello to you as you walked by. You don’t always see that. I especially liked Yolanda at check-in. She was very funny and helped us find the perfect room for our short stay. We got to the the room and I called for extra sheets for the sofa bed. She had already sent them up before I even called. Impressive. 
4.  Nice pool. Indoor and outdoor that is connected. 

I only had two minor suggestions- 
1.  They need signs in the hallways which way your room is. 
2.  I could not find a website or up to date menu for their restaurant. They should have the menu and pricing on their site.

924940077_208452,"Nice Property but Check the Folio on Award Stays I usually redeem the Amex Aspire free night certificate at this property since the midtown Conrad is usually unavailable. Recently I was upgraded to a suite thanks to Lifetime Diamond status. Unfortunately they made a mistake and tried to charge me $1300 for the suite when it should have been covered by the certificate. I didn't realize what had happened until I was already on the subway headed to the airport. Thought I could solve the problem in the Hilton app chat, but no dice. Had to email their business office. Fortunately someone was working there on a Sunday evening and promptly reversed the charge. 

That said the property is very nicely located on a quiet street but a fair walk to any subway line. You'll definitely get your steps in. The filtered water machine in the room is a nice touch as are the sliding doors to the bedroom. Breakfast is expensive and slow. Until the midtown Conrad calms down on point redemtions or the Waldorf Astoria reopens (2030 maybe?) I'll continue to use the free night certificate at this property.",11/7/23

There have been no updates to the rooms, and on our last stay, our suite had stained carpet, a stained sofa, and multiple scratches and stains on the walls and doors.  Toilets were very spotty and would barely flush, and water pressure was hit or miss.

In addition, the quality of the breakfast has declined over time.  There is little in the way of fruit, condiments are limited, and the quality of the coffee is mediocre at best.

We have enjoyed staying here in previous years, but will probably be looking for a more updated and better value option for our next stay in Abilene.",11/26/22

Modern, casual, open concept lobby...a little noisy, and doesn't project luxury.  The room had great bones, but the decorating was odd.  For example, a marble top table but then a monkey in a cowboy hat lamp, cheap pictures.  I think they were going for hip, but it came off to me as cheap.  The room was quiet.  More than once, we had to wait for the next elevator because the maid's cart took up the whole space.  You would think there was a freight elevator somewhere they could have used.  The shower is a little cheap looking too with a fiberglass floor.  I think maybe we weren't their target audience because we are in our 50's.

They even joked with us over being the away team fans. The front desk was friendly as was the security staff. It would be hard to beat the location with the metro link across the street and Enterprise Arena a block away. Plus it was walkable to union station and the arch.

Stayed 20mins from my destination expecting I’d be able to get reliable help with meals- I have a severe food allergy. Marriott can usually be counted on to help with this special need. It’s a total pain in the rear.  I get it.  Alas, I don’t not find this restaurant reliable at all. 

1) Little to no GF options in the restaurant and most staff untrained to help, except the chef.  I have celiac, identified my allergy and then was served a dish with panko bread crumbs all over it.  The chef helped me redo, as far as I can tell, the dinner menu has one item that is GF. Then, I’m told no breakfast options — none—-available to me in the restaurant. 

2) no safes in the rooms. They offer to watch your stuff at the desk.  I don’t have time to wait to check my valuables in and out every time I leave my room. So I’m hauling my briefcase everywhere- such an inconvenience.",10/10/22

905633283_10055435,"You need to ""opt in"" if you want your room cleaned! We were very taken aback at Hilton’s post Covid policy where the room is not cleaned, unless you specifically request it. This was an expensive weekend so to find that a room wasn’t cleaned, or fresh towels provided just seems a cheap money saving policy. While, I haven’t stayed in too many hotels in the last couple of years I have stayed in other chains that still clean rooms as part of the normal service, so this seems to be a Hilton specific policy. The only way we found about this was when we were directed to the note on the desk that we didn't see when we arrived. I do think the Hilton should be making it clearer about this policy when guests check in but of course they don’t want to do that because then that probably would cost the hotel more money.  This definitely impacted our overall experience in what should’ve been a beautiful location and a lovely weekend. I would also note that the extra we paid for the river view was really a waste of money because they were huge trees in the way so we were really unable to see much of the water which we had also paid extra for.",7/26/23

We waited for approximately 1.5 hours to check in. while others went ahead of us.  Some issue with our voucher but never explained.  Other guests expressed concern for the wheelchair couple waiting to check in.  Once in the room, it was effectively non functional.  It was too narrow to push the wheelchair into the room by the ends of the bed.  The path between the beds was also too narrow for a wheelchair.

In room, the peeling wallpaper around the tub (room 412) could use attention. Otherwise up to date and clean. Walls must be paper thin as I was awakened by conversation two mornings. I was not advised what to expect with housekeeping (don’t mind if they don’t come every day but I like to know what to expect) and the one day I was out of the room all day it was not serviced. They should give you more towels initially tho if not doing daily cleaning. Free Wi-Fi should be a staple at this point — silly they charge you or make you log into your Hilton honors account. Room service doesn’t do lunch so nothing available between 11a and 5p. They have an airport shuttle but the driver isn’t always there so it may or may not be helpful.

It had the strong odor of fresh pain upon arrival, and many of the fixtures were yet to be installed, including closet doors and hangers. Toilet paper was just stacked upon the back of the toilet, and one of the bathroom doors couldn't be closed as it hit up against the toilet itself. Plus, the smoke detectors were covered in painter's tape -- a fact we didn't even notice until we were in bed. I shared my concerns with the front desk, and we were promised a follow-up by the GM, but haven't heard anything in two weeks, so felt this was worth sharing.  Overall, not a great representation of a Marriott property.",6/24/23

We paid $109 for room 213, the room was nice, clean, and perhaps a little rough around the edges but that is true and acceptable of all motels that are not brand new.  So I was very happy with what we got.
The only negative I could say was that the wood floor above us was very thin and creaked everytime the room above us walked around, luckily they were quiet people.  Next time I would ask for a 3rd floor room.  We were on the west side of the building away from the freeway just in case there was road noise, but we had no outside noise problem.  Also the variety of hot breakfast items was very good, the typical oatmeal, waffles, eggs, sausage and misc items were provided.

And their is no ice bucket for the ice machine. Onto the good: there is a mini fridge, coffee pot (rations for one person) hair dryer, iron and a big tv and Wi-Fi. The air conditioners worked great and kept the room COLD. There was minimal disturbance from outside noises, we could walk to food joints. There’s a Waffle House built in to the side of the reception area.

When we arrived, one of the rooms we were given to us was occupied. The next room that was given to them smelled strongly of Marijuana, as if someone had been smoking in there just recently. The floors in all the rooms were so disgusting that all of our socks turned brown/black just walking around. The bathroom sink in one of the rooms took 15 minutes to drain, there were ""Little Tree"" car scent things attached to the air ducts in the rooms which is something I have never seen before. The lighting in these rooms is pitiful at best, and some lights were actually strobing. One of the comforters in a room was full of cigarette burn holes, and many of the towels were stained/ browning. If I could give a 0 star rating I would.

Mariano's service was impeccable - he was attentive, knowledgeable about the menu, and ensured that our drinks were always full.

However, I do have a slight complaint about the vegetarian food options. While Mariano did an outstanding job in every other aspect, the vegetarian choices on the menu left much to be desired. As a vegetarian, I was hoping for more creative and flavorful options, but the choices were limited and somewhat bland.

Despite this, Mariano's excellent service and attentiveness more than made up for the limited vegetarian selection. His professionalism and dedication to ensuring we had a great dining experience were truly commendable.

924829410_185747,"Fairmont d'Or We used Accor suite upgrades on a booking on the Fairmont Gold floor, which gave a great room.  Very spacious.  Lovely bathroom.  Comfortable bed.  The Fairmont d'Or lounge is extremely comfortable and quiet for working and relaxing, plus the food quality at breakfast and in the evening is extremely high.  Gym facility in the basement is excellent.

2 critiques:
- the building is huge and a bit unwieldy.  I think the 60s style refurb has done a great job with what is fairly compromised fabric.  The corridors are wide, but the ceilings low.  There are lots of windowed corridors, but the views are obscured by blinds.  Overall, I didn't love the building.
- Fairmont d'Or could be better explained.  It's sort of a hotel within a hotel (almost) but more than an exec lounge.  We queued to check in downstairs, only to be told that we should be using the (very nice and quiet) check in on the 21st floor.  But once you've queued....

The Executive lounge is ""permanently"" closed per the staff...kinda devalues Diamond Status. 5. Breakfast Buffet is way over priced at $25. Even if you are a Diamond Member the F&B credit does not come close to covering the buffet. 5. The signage at breakfast does not mention that there is an option to order from the menu as opposed to the buffet and even when I asked I was pushed towards the buffet. 7.

Upside: 
(1) Efficient air-conditioning - came in useful on one of the hottest days so far this summer.
(2) Comfortable beds.
(3) Very clean room & bathroom for an older, budget hotel.
(4) Reasonably priced parking - ordinarily costs roughly half that of downtown hotels. Since Lake Union is adjacent to downtown, this hotel's a good alternative to downtown hotels with more expensive parking if you intend to drive within the metro area. As it turned out, we were given complimentary parking.

(1) Very slow elevators. Luckily, hotel only has 6 floors.",6/15/23

Room was not even dusted in a very long time. Room needs lots of maintenance and cleaning. Please check out pics to prove what I'm saying is simply not an opinion but factual.

As a Platinum Elite member, loyalty to iHG properties is important to me, but so are clean, comfortable rooms, courteous staff, and a good overall impression.

The breakfast staff  tried to close down 10 minutes early and were rude about it. My wife and I went to the front desk to complain and a gentleman talked to the staff but nothing changed.  I even emailed the GM Steve, I believe is his name, before my stay to request a renovated or at least clean room, but it fell on deaf ears with no return email.

We didn’t care as we had used points and we’re only there for a quick overnight. 

On a positive note, the hotel is directly connected to Tysons Galleria which is the high end mall. We did have breakfast at the ritz which was quite good and service was efficient. We also liked the complementary welcome bags for our kids as well as the mimosas for adults.

It surpassed all expectations, from the rooms (which had been refurbished from last time) to the well kept grounds, to the incredible entertainment and the exquisite restaurants which you would never tire from. And of course the incredible staff, they can never do enough for you. I would like to give a special mention to a couple of staff members, the first being Charlene, who was based at the transient mojito stand, the cocktails had been incredible but service even better. Tiana who was based at the beer hut was our daughters favourite, she took such a shine, and Tiana was amazing with her. And lastly but by no means least Antonio, he was based at the Indian restaurant (and the reason we came back 3 times) he couldn’t do enough for the family, so hospitable, friendly and courteous a great addition to the Grand Palladium team.

Room was huge. Two queen beds and a couch, microwave/fridge, bathroom, TV.

Breakfast was pretty good and there was coffee/tea available throughout the day in the lobby.

I had to personally go to the registration desk to pickup K-cups twice and they had no creamers in my two day stay. I had to take the creamers from the restaurant after our expensive breakfast the first morning. 
The paper coffee cups where nice in that that they had ridging on the outside to protect ones hands from the heat but in less than a half-hour they starting leaking badly along all of the seams.  Leaked on the end tables by the beds and dripped on our clothing.  We are frequent coffee drinkers but the coffee service was terrible!!!! 
On the positive side, the room was very good and the ability to sit on the balcony in rocking chairs to view the golf course and enjoy the nice weather was appreciated.

Pros:
- Quiet and remote location of the property 

Cons:
- Broken toilet seat
- Hanging light fixture in the bathroom with exposed wires. See picture. 
- Can flushing toilets all day and night
- Not just outdated, it is obvious how the ownership just “masked” things to save money on updates and repairs. Very shoddy work. 
- No quiet hours whatsoever. Doors slamming, kids running around on our floor. Note to parents, respect others and show your kids why that’s important. 
- Barely functioning thermostat in our room. Another corner cut. See picture.

We were in our room two minutes and decided it wasn’t going to work and checked out. We called Hilton Honors who tried to assist as my husband is a diamond member, but the GM refused to give us a refund. We will never stay there again as this was shabby treatment on their part.

I rate 3 stars simply because the renovated room was fairly nice, and most importantly I was able to sleep well here. The staff tried hard and was very accommodating, which was another plus. 

There's a long list of negatives associated with the renovation: hard to find the lobby, hard to find your room, lots of construction between the elevator and your room, only some elevators go to the floors you need, a couple floors of the parking garage looked like they'd been demolished, many signs guide you to the fitness center but when you get there it's closed, etc. 

Once the renovations are done the experience here will be dramatically better.",11/14/23

We had requested a late check-out, and again, they never got back to us. We ended up having to leave the room to just find out that they granted us with the late check out at reception. 
Location - not central at all. If you don't have a car, the options to move around the town are limited. They do offer s shuttle service to the centre though.

The fee was supposed to be $25 a day, but they charged us $50 a day, & we didn’t get that bill until we were on our way home. Our dog had zero accidents, so there should be no reason for an extra fee. Also, the key card to the pool wasn’t working.

My biggest complaint was the noise from several sources: the walls and floors have no insulation, so heard elephants above us parading at all hours, babies crying during the night, vacuuming halls during the day and street noise at all hours. Minor issue is the bathroom had exactly one hook for clothes/towels, whoever designed it never had to use it.   We also had limited hot water during parts of our stay.

The elevator is also sort of janky and slow (and only 1 of the 2 elevators appeared to be in working order during our stay).

Entertainment at the resort is average but dont forget you are 2-3 mins away from all the live music on the streets at the open restaurants which we took full advantage of.  There is no supper buffet only a la cartes and the only disappointing feature to this 4.5* resort is quality of food as it was only average but needs to be better for 4.5* resort.

I booked using points and I thought I would have trouble changing my room from a basic king to a room with two queens after having to bring my son along at the last minute.  Andy made the switch effortlessly.  He also let us check in super early after a very long flight from Ohio.  It was just an amazing experience.   Stress free (and I spent the flight worrying we would have to move hotels). The room was lovely and the hotel was in a great central location.  We walked to the art museum and Powell bookstore (also voodoo donuts as my son was curious).  We missed the wine hour unfortunately.  But I can highly recommend this hotel.,6/23/23

Not so great: 

Mediocre breakfast - not many choices, soupy undercooked oatmeal, watery eggs.  The breakfast was crowded on the morning I was there with several teens present - presumably in town for an event. The attendant  loudly asked everyone to clean up after themselves (leaving plates etc..on the counter) then audibly mumbled (paraphrasing here) that these are adults and shouldn't have to be told.

There is no maid service or towel refresh unless you stay five nights. We ran out of towels and trash bins were overflowing.  You will also be navigating the maid service stay all day in the hallways and elevators. I’ve never seen a hotel that the maid service interviews with your ability to use an elevator or walk down the hall. We booked an ocean view hotel. What we got was a side view of the ocean. That was blocked largely  by a neighboring hotel with an ugly roof. Finally the hotel just doesn’t have basic amenities. There is no business center - even a small one. There are no beach amenities except for a small chair for rent for $50 a day. The pool is very small and over run with kids. And the beach towels are ragged.,10/30/23

The room was a standard room fitted with expected items such as a tv, desk, safe and AC and the bathroom had a walk in shower. The room itself would have benefitted from some TLC. Our sleep was good and the bed was comfy but it is easy to be woke up very earlier by everything happening outside coke the morning (traffic, road works, etc). But I guess this is to be expected in the city that never sleeps. There are three lifts to go up and down which probed to be of great difficulty because of the number of people trying to use them at once.

If there’s one thing I’d say for them to improve is that I hope when the staff is taking the luggage from taxis or cars to put them in their cart, I hope they do so with care. Also, I hope that the the person receiving calls for IRD can be friendlier. My friend said that the person he talked to actually seemed to care less and in a hurry.

Also, they aren't large enough to hold the corners of the mattress so you are battling that.  No mini fridge in the suite.  Getting ice turned into something of a joke.

In my opinion.... it is an unsafe situation with not much headroom (there is a picture of this), a potential trip hazard near the top of the stairs and a support cable across the stairs near the turn duck if you are tall (there is a picture of this). We did not feel the risk of sleeping upstairs was worth it so we carried the mattress downstairs to sleep. It was not pleasant and the price of this unit should be far less as a result.

Their hot tub hasn't worked apparently in several years. When I received my bill, the parking and resort fee were higher than I was quoted. The dust on the surfaces in the room was easy to see. They don't clean rooms during the stay and you have to find the maid to get fresh towels. I used to be a platinum member but apparently throwing a couple grand no longer moves the needle much.  I guess my days as total rewards member have come to an end.  I'll stay at another casino property before I think to return to Harveys. Lastly, my room's wall was next to the elevator.

I'm a Marriott Ambassdor Elite, but that is not the point and overall, not very important.   My stay was only one night and it clearly states the check out time as 12:00pm.   By 9:30am, I heard a knock on a door, I did not think was my door. Housekeeping may have attempted to knock again, I am not sure.  While sitting at the table in the suite, I literally hear someone trying to break in.   I open the door and see someone from maintenance trying to break the latch open to get in.  Behind him are two housekeeping staff.   Do you not check to see that it would be my check out date, and the check out time.  Are there no records of  daily check in and check outs.   Knocking on the door once and getting no answer, does not entitle sending up a man to break down the door.   How about using the telephone to call.   Terrifying to say the least",11/23/22

The look of the hotel is fresh and contemporary. More importantly, as a Bonvoy Platinum member I got an actual upgrade, rather than the usual rehearsed 'thank you for being a loyal customer'. My room on the concierge floor was great, with the only drawback of having a small bathroom. That didn't really bother me, and it's probably a consequence of the old design. But keep that in mind if you like sizeable bathrooms.
Both the M Club and the gym (featuring a sauna) are as they should always be: spacious and upscale. The breakfast was particularly good as it was not limited to a few options as happens normally in the US, but offered a full breakfast.
The only issue was with the heating, as the temperature in the room could not exceed 20° celsius, which is not a lot. The hotel sent a maintenance guy, but there was nothing he could do, and I was delivered a small heater instead.

10/10 worth every penny. The massage on the water was fantastic. The masseuse was nice and checked on the pressure regularly. To hear the waves was relaxing. 

Check In at the hotel was smooth. Have your card ready. 

Food - We opted for the food packagae. It comes with a drink and meal. Let me tell you the grilled garlic lobster was soooooooo good. I really wanted to go back for the lobster. 

Boat- The tide was high and the boat ride was rocky. We sat in the back to avoid getting wet. The boat wait was about 20-30 mins each time. We used that time to take pictures and eat. 

Island- There are 2 sides 1. flamingo 2. Iguana. Im from Florida so seeing iguanas was nowhere on my list. We did go to that side to us bathroom and get massage. 

Flamingo- Some tips. Get there early. I noticed after a certain time the flamingos were hot, tired, and not hungry for the food. For me, the birds kept trying to steal the food out of our hands which was really scary.

The positives:
- convenient location near I-65
- nice looking, well kept property
- the complimentary dinner was satisfactory, and we appreciated not having to venture out for dinner
- the breakfast had good selection and quality

The disappointments:
- I thought this highway was far enough from I-65 to minimize road noise, but we definitely heard plenty all night, both from the Interstate but also from the busy roads surrounding the property (and the number of drivers with excessively loud vehicles).  We've probably stayed at more than 100 properties in the last 3 years, and I can only think of one other that had has much road noise.

The body wash canister was broken and pulled away from the wall. A/C was cold however when it shuts off an extremely disruptive noise follows that sounds like a lid being slammed shut to the a/c ducts, enough to wake someone up from a sound sleep at night. 
The spa: the women's spa area had a small whirlpool and nice size sauna room. Comfortable robes were provided in each locker and complimentary towels, bath sandals, and additional beauty supplies (combs, brushes, mouthwash, etc..) were available.

I actually chose this room as I prefer to stay on the first floor.  I have yet been able to sleep past 8:30 as the door to this room is paper thin!  The elevator is nowhere near me and I can hear it!  I can hear the maids talking, I can hear doors opening and closing.  I have only one other time had a door that is so thin.

Another thing that I thought would be included in the resort fee. Honestly not sure what the resort fee includes since it seemed like everything was an additional cost.

What is there to love? The location! It’s in the heart of everything- Duval, Mallory Square and the historic seaport so it’s an easy walk anywhere. The grounds are also so lush and tropical so you feel like you’re secluded when you want some peace. I also love that it’s on the water and there is a great beach bar. We had positive encounters with all the staff, several of whom have been there for years. The only drawback, but to be expected in Key West, was the loud wake up calls from the roosters every morning! An interior room may be a little quieter that faces the pool or the gardens.

Keys were provided with no envelope and did not work consistently.  The room I stayed in was exceptionally clean and very comfortable, but minor maintenance had not been attended to (chipped and peeling paint, broken screen, only 1 desk chair).  The breakfast provided was good but nothing special, not as I remembered from the last visit.  This year the host provided yogurt, a few apples, bagels, toast, waffles, a few hot items, several dry cereal options.  It looked like there were many families among the guests, also sports teams and perhaps construction crews.  The hotel is very convenient to the airport.  The grounds are spacious and nice to walk in.  There is a picnic table provided around the back.  Pretty setting in a very busy area.

We only wish management would pay as much attention to pet urine odors as they do to smoke. The chemicals the housekeepers used to cover up the pet odor almost knocked us out when we first opened the door.  We went back up to reception (before moving in) to ask if all rooms were like that but no personnel were behind the counter, nor anywhere in sight.

The phones were still down, as was the internet, so we had to walk down 3 flights of stairs (that has no lights in them) to the front desk to have them tell us basically ""nothing we can do about it.""

The hotel is very dated and in need of a major renovation. When we checked in we found out about the pools  When we got in to the room the carpet in places was peeling up. The dresser they had the tv sitting on When u moved the drawers they would fall out.  The sofa  was wore out.  The blankets was put on the bed so tight they looked nice and flat. When you pull the blankets back there was a huge divot in the center of the bed couldn’t even sleep in the bed it was so bad  worst night I ever spent in a hotel.  Went up the next morning to the front desk Ask for a manager The man at the desk was reluctant to get a manager  Foundly said he would get a manager the lady that came out to the desk to talk to me wasn’t dressed as a manager  She was wearing a stitch shirt  not very professional at all for a Marriott hotel  I do not recommend staying in this hotel,2/7/23

We had a room with a connecting door and no sound proof at all so we had to call the front desk as next door guest were make a lot of noise past 10pm. Overall not a very pleasant experience. Had 2 transaction debited from my card under hilton foundation and front desk staff had no clue about it and just asked me to call my bank and dispute the charges instead.

I wouldn’t recommend it.",10/23/22

Well, I needed something and I received nothing. When I got to my room, the switch did not work any lights. I wanted to turn the TV on but the remote would not work. I tried to call down but the phone did not work in the room. I called via my cell phone and informed her about the remote not working. She said she would program another one and send it up. I never received the remote so I was unable to watch TV the entire night. While waiting, I checked around the room. One dresser drawer was broken and it caused all three to be unusable. There was something splattered on the ceiling above the bed. It was rather disgusting. Plumbing most also be bad as the tub took overnight to drain as well as the sink. Also, the toilet was running water and would not stop. I do not recommend staying at this hotel and I no longer plan to stay at a Best Western. I was very disappointed.",10/21/22

We changed our rooms 6 times and end up biting the bullet until the next morning and immediately checked out and got a room at the Marriott in Knoxville. The staff was great and handled the situation tremendously well. Sadly we will never stay at this location ever again. Thanks again to management, but I wish they had better help because this place can really be brought up to part if they thoroughly clean & renovated, take pride in their establishment. Hopes this helps.",9/3/23

A very informal hotel which is definitely overpriced for the services. Location is great and close to the main street in Brickell where you find a lot of restaurants and shops. Brickell city center is just 5 minutes walk and Little Havana is  pretty close as well. Breakfast was really sad and we were there 3 nights. Tried 3 different times btw 6.30 and 9.30 and at all times most of the dishes were empty and had to wait for them or ask to be replenished. Most items ...not a great variety were hardly topped up. Please avoid a room and breakfast package unless you are on work and ok with a quick bite. Reception staff are least helpful and need a bit of training in hospitality.

The only thing you should be made aware of is parking charges. Each time I have been assured that parking fees were paid up front in my reservation only to be charged again on check-out with the manager saying they were not, even with proof on the reservation. This has happened every time, seems like a way to make a few extra dollars and tends to piss you off when your trying to escape such conflicts.

1. As a titanium elite member I was told check-in was at 10am. However, we couldn't check -in until 4pm.

2. The pool/beach area was dirty and the beach chairs and umbrellas were ripped and torn, with the foam showing.

The bathroom floors had hair and did not look like they had been mopped or cleaned. The walls in the bathroom had make up or other substance on the walls. The doors on the outside definitely needed to be repainted as well, but that was the least of our concerns. Hotel management needs to take a good look at their cleaning procedures.",1/15/23

They gave me a smoking room and told me it was the last one available. Several people showed up after us and didn't have a room.
This is not staffing shortage. They overbooked and knew it. Do not go here.
The breakfast was terrible. They did not have the appropriate amount of food for everyone, and we arrived hours before it closed. The drinks were not set up, so you either had coffee, orange juice (which ran out), or nothing.

They won't let anyone in who hasn't purchased a chair so our group was split and I though we needed to buy chairs while in Baha Cay.  Beach side I purchased day beds in first row and came to find a day ahead that they were in 3 rd row.  After arguing with a manager I got my money back.  Spa - doesn't have any amenities - just tea or water while you wait which when you pay this much for treatment should!  Even towels at the spa you have to ask for.

Location
Room was very comfortable and spacious
Bathroom was nice and big and modern.
That is the extent of my positive experience.

But the staff at the front desk ALL of them were the most rudest people I have ever ever come across. If it was just 1 staff that was rude I would say that I was unlucky. I had dealings with 3 different staff members on my stay, One was ruder than the next. I actually think they must be told to be as rude as you can be because their is no other reasoning as to the level of rudeness that I recievied.  Not one of them must be happy in their job. I have emailed the hotel 7 times and have not got one response.

One of the biggest issues we had was that the entire weekend only 1 out of the 3 elevators was in service which made it difficult for us to bring our gear up and down. several occasions I was waiting for 3 to 4 elevators to go by before there was room to get on. The front desk although friendly were not accommodating to our basic needs when in need of assistance. The hotel does not have a Vending Machine or any kind of store where you can buy a drink or get a snack of any kind which we found other hotels in the area had because we went over and used them. The rooms were clean and well maintained throughout our visit so I will commend the cleaning staff. The location was great because it was right where you could access many different sites.

No clock in room, safe didn't work, tub finish was rubbed off and the smell of a wet dog couldn't be covered up with my Febreze spray or perfume. We had to shove a towel under the room door to block out the light from the hallway. Inserted in our room key packet was a note stating that room refreshes only occur upon request 24 hours in advance. How about you refresh my room unless I ask you not to?

The water pressure and temperature were good.  Unfortunately, I had requested a top floor room not facing the highway and they were not able to able to accommodate that request (initially or when moved).  I could hear traffic noise despite bringing a fan.  Also, the room we were moved to had light shining in from the parking lot and hotel sign.  The breakfast was not as expected - no scrambled eggs or similar so I ended up needing to buy breakfast for my son who was there for a water polo tournament.

It's disheartening that Legacy Hotel appears to have forgotten the essence of hospitality. I do not recommend staying here unless you're willing to sacrifice basic courtesy and decent service. Please consider other options for a more enjoyable stay.",7/14/23

BUT the staff at the check in were awful, especially an African American lady who received us after a 9 hour car ride by ""wait there and we will call you when our system is back"".
After waiting a while, we enquired on an estimated time for check-in. Same lady's response was ""your check-in time is 4 pm so leave your phone and we will call you when ready"".
They never called so 5:30 pm we ventured back to the check-in desk.
Same lady had no apologies for failing to call but addressed us with a cold ""your ID and credit card"" greeting. She wasn't too happy when I sarcastically added the word ""please"" to the end of her demand.

Almost no entertainment except a jazz player in lobby at night. The worst regarding meal choices was that each restaurant was only offering 4 meal choices. The food was not to our likings at all. We are typically easy to please. Last evening they shut down the other restaurants due to a wedding party occupying Oceana. We thought this was not right and had to eat at the Italian restaurant again, with nearly same choices as the other 2 evenings.

1. The neighborhood is a deserted, grim, somewhat frightening at night landscape. Coming home at 10 PM from the Lechmere T station is a bit scary.
2. Parking is bad. There is a free on site garage but it is woefully undersized for this property. Spots are first come, first served. and if it's full, tough luck.
3. If you don't get into the garage there are no other nearby options. Street parking is mostly forbidden and I'm not sure you want to street park in that neighborhood anyway.
4. Staff isn't that great either. Example: We ran out of toilet paper (no extras in our room) and called the front desk. They said come down and then gave us one roll.

The hot breakfast buffet was ample, Dwayne at the from desk was downright charming,  and when we had trouble figuring out the TV, a maintenance person arrived within minutes and fixed it.
We were within easy walking distance to Boston Pizza , and Swiss Chalet as well as a shopping mall. 
Our only complaint was the same as we find at all hotels- the heating/cooling system- finicky, and a bit noisy.  Hard to keep a constant suitable temperature.
That said, we would definitely  return to this hotel",11/23/22

Everyone we talked with at the front desk was amazingly friendly and professional -- they made this place stand out.

From the check-staff, breakfast area employees, housekeeping, etc. 
I think they’ve found the friendliest, most professional people they could to work here and it shows. 
We purposely reserve rooms here when we’re in town. 
I love the small town feel; the friendliness, the ease with which it is to stay there knowing anything that comes up will be handled right away.

867281785_89538,Great Service !!! I travel to Baltimore quite often and when i do this is my go to hotel each time. When i come i normally interact with Ms Tangi. I think its funny because at first i thought her name was tangerine and thats only because she says tangi like tangerine. However she is always there making sure everyone is satisfied safe and happy overall. She is always smiling and have a warmth about her that just shines so bright. She is one of the main reasons i continue to come because she makes you feel like you are at home when your away from your home just by her attentiveness. You can tell she genuinely enjoys what she is doing. She needs to be a manager in my opinion. As a fellow business owner I would love to have someone like Tangi on my team. If only i lived in Baltimore i would have Tangi come train my employees on customer service and or to be a member of my team.

Upon my arrival the outside of hotel was clean and valet was very outgoing with big smiles which was very welcoming. The lady valet, Anasia was quick to grab my door as the gentleman, Blaise grabbed my bags. They were very friendly and efficient. Also later when I called for my car they both remembered my name, which made me feel special. Check in was a breeze, although be beware there's an early checkin fee. My room was very clean and had a wonderful view. I would suggest having at least one complimentary bottled water in the room. The hotel's location was super convenient to the park and restaurants. There's some neat running trails nearby too. Honestly the staff was the most inviting & personal staff I've experienced at a hotel. I will definitely be back next time I'm in passing through. Thank you.",8/22/23

It is the place to stay for the Seattle Kraken games. The rooms are incredibly large, and Adam fully furnished for my needs. It was very clean. I have to say that. Breakfast staff was fantastic, front desk, staff, amazing and housekeeping department always great. Parking is a tiny bit difficult because it’s short and I have a large SUV. There is another hotel connected to this hotel, which at times can be a little confusing when you’re going to your room. But, if you look at the room numbers and the numbers in the beginning of the room number are not ones that would be on. You weren’t remember you know you’re going the wrong way. Beautiful new hotel.

I was up here in the frozen north to visit a long time friend I met in the Army and this hotel is close to the airport while being near enough to everything that an Uber doesn't cost a leg.

929109084_209406,"3 stars. Was good but not perfect.  Likely wouldnt return. 

Service was 5/5. Cannot say enough how impressed I was with the staff, they are great. Super conscientious. Very helpful. 

Everything else was lackluster. I'll mostly cover the big stuff.

1) The Guest Wifi network didnt extend through the entire hotel, so if you wander into a quiet area to do some work (such as the mezz conference area), you'd be out of luck
2) The TVs categorically did not work well, specifically Netflix was functionally broken. 
3) The elevators need to be upgraded. During our stay there, 2 out of the 3 elevators were out of commission. Imagine the nightmare elevator traffic
4) No one seemed to know where the service elevator was
5) No one seemed to know where the stairs were (it was obvious where they were) and they are also one way stairs (you can go down but not up), which is fine under normal circumstances but when your elevators don't work, it's pretty bad. 

For something that was branded The Ritz-Carlton, I think the above 5 things are unacceptable.",12/10/23

We drove 8 hours to this hotel and arrived at 1am to find the hotel in disrepair (later found out there was a flood). We had no warning and the hotel was largely under construction and very torn apart, no efforts to make the damaged areas presentable for guests. 

Our first hotel room we went into did not have any light as the bulbs were burnt out and it smelt like wet dog and I couldn’t stomach it. We did change to a different room that smelt way better but we paid for a King bed room and ended up with a Queen bed with no change in price. 

The room itself was probably a 2.5/5 in cleanliness (hair in the tub, orange juice stains on the door, lots of dirt etc) and the furniture was just super rundown. 

Because it was the weekend of Taylor Swift and Pride we couldn’t find another location to move to otherwise we would have. 

Not worth the $150/night we paid.",6/25/23

Unfortunately, there are two huge issues in this location that make it a very difficult stay.  The hotel is surrounded on three sides by major construction projects.  Traffic and movement in and out of the hotel is challenging and will be for at least a couple of years. Secondly, the hotel is adjacent to Rainey Street which is a VERY busy bar scene. Music blares from the bars until 2am.  Our 15th floor room was on the Rainey St side and even with ear plugs and white noise, the music made it hard to sleep.

The staff was very pleasant and efficient. We checked in around 11 pm and the process was very smooth. They were also kind enough to take a late night food order (I believe the kitchen had already closed). 
Hotel was very clean, bathroom set-up is a little cramped (location of shower door); however, the overall suite was very nice - loved the layout. The only complaint was the room AC - older unit, so it's a bit loud when it kicks in - it also did not get as cool as expected (my two co-workers had no issues with their AC units, so I believe it was just limited to my room).

In addition to the property being beautiful and so well maintained, the staff from front office to engineering is so professional and accommodating. I travel a great deal for work and have elite status with both Bonvoy and Hilton so I have stayed at many properties and interacted with many staff members over the years. This is the first time I have ever been compelled to write a review. If you want first class service with genuine hospitality, this is your place. You can tell when service with a smile is real or not and these guys went above and beyond to help, their genuine care for customer service speaks volumes. Kudos to the entire staff and many thanks to Reese and Graham.",4/6/23

Plus the free breakfast that beats their neighbor ""The Courtyard"" doesn't hurt. There are new faces from last time I stayed,  but they treated me like they already knew me the second I walked in. Same with the staff I brought with me. I will stay whenever I need to come to the area, and will review every time my stay is flawless as they deserve all the credit!

This Hilton is usually our go-to when visiting Guadalajara. The staff is very lovely and always willing to help. 

Starting with the front desk, Karla and Cynthia were very efficient and handled whatever we needed correctly.

Dining Staff: Marco, the head chef, Rosario, who makes excellent cheesy & crispy quesadillas and gorditas. Jonathan, Jose, Arturo, and two ladies who were serving I didn't get their names. They were always on top of serving and ensured we had everything we needed. Since I was there for a while, they knew I drank almond milk and would have it ready, which I appreciate those tiny details.

Food at the Pool is delicious. I can't say the same for the Happy Hour, but the views make up for it.

She was honest and up-front about what she could offer, and then overdelivered on our expectations.

The hotel is in a great location, close to everything downtown and quick to get to off the highway

The best thing about this hotel is the reception and customer service. I’ve never had such great service from all staff. 

Parking was right beside the main entrance and was an extra fee but easy to access with in and out access every day. 

Breakfast was included with our plan - the fruit, pastries and yogurt was great. The eggs and other food in the chafing dishes were never even warm. So we just stuck to the pastries 

We were in room 1401 - a one bedroom with river view. The view was amazing. The room was HUGE and had everything we needed. We loved the full size fridge. We NEVER had issues with noise or heard any emergency vehicle sirens. Our room was very clean 

Only 2 negatives for us - there was no fan in the toilet/shower area. That would have been good for our family. 

The beds were extremely uncomfortable - we definitely looked forward to being home in our own beds after the 3rd night. 

We would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to be downtown Ottawa !",5/3/23

There is some construction going on within the hotel and the beach across the street is closed for construction.  The public beaches in Bocagrande are full of vendors trying to sell you something. We could not relax. I recommend doing a boat tour of some of the islands. We did the private beach at Baru Playa  Eco Beach Resort. This was very relaxing! I also recommend checking out the beaches in LaBonquilla, not far from the hotel about a 15min car ride. These beaches have local restaurants and do not get many tourist.

There is a pool, bar, restaurant and another bar that becomes a Starbucks in the morning. Like everywhere else in Miami, prices are very high for drinks and food. Restaurant food was decent and they do have some specials. One good thing to know is that on cruise departure days, the elevators seem to stand still and you have to wait a long time. We found this out from another guest on our arrival to the hotel, so on our departure day we went down to lobby early and waited there until it was time to leave.

I thought  my hotel was a decent enough place until I came by to see my friends at Avanti. Firstly, the lobby just stands out and you can tell that management is keen on the first impressions. It was bright, clean and lively. Walk 30 seconds more and BANG, I am already in a large spacious pool area inviting me to jump in. Grounds were very clean, I felt safe and the staff were just amazing. Had a great flavorful quesadilla from Marilina in the cafe and then to top it off had a super experience at the bar with Elijah who served up the most refreshing rum runners (no myers rum tho), nevertheless, it was fantastic. I had such a great time just visiting here, that I checked out of my hotel and bunked with my friends on the last night. I gotta come back for a longer stay though and really enjoy all this property has going on. There is a kiddies game room, and like a pool hall in the lobby.

There's a Macaw that sits alone in a plexiglass cage all day without even ONE toy or anything to occupy his mind. Turtle enclosures are small, full of algae and filthy and again - nothing in them but a platform or two. Really despicable conditions for the bird and turtles. Shame on Hyatt.

The first stay was a matter of convenience and availability. Every other stay this property has been an absolute first choice and a blessing. The most recent visit, one in our party needed an accessible room. The person (I failed to get her name)  I spoke to on the phone to help me adjust the reservation was extremely patient, understanding and kind. I travel a lot for work but I can not explain how much it means to know my family was treated well in the most difficult time. It is so much more important than having all the bells and whistles.

I asked for late check-out and they were able to help me out.  The staff at the restaurant accommodate my special request for a protein bowl to keep it healthy and they whipped up something yummy!

As for the room perfect size.  Comfortable bed.  Decent TV channel selection.  Very safe area (business park) with plenty of food options.

We asked for and were given a quiet room away from the main Street and I think that would be important as the street at the front of the hotel would be noisy. Our 12th floor room was quiet and with a comfy bed and dark curtains, sleep was easy. The adjoining coffee shop on the ground floor is excellent - great coffee and some good breakfast options.

The pools are so clean. The adult pool is quiet and has a great drink selection. 

I must give the highest rating to the cleanliness. Every corner of this huge property is meticulously maintained. This place sparkles. My wife wipes down every piece of gym equipment she uses with a towel prior to use to see if she can find dirt or grime. In this gym, she wasn’t able find a trace of dirt on anything. The entire resort is this clean. 

Final word of thanks to Manuela from the beach walk pool service team and Jose at the pizza shop. These two individuals took the time to know me and my wife and to care for us as if we were part of their family. We will never forget them or our wonderful stay at the JW Marriott in Cancun!",4/2/23

I could happily have stayed here a week.
I had a lovely long swim in the beautiful pool but was surprised there are no changing rooms, I had to go into the unisex toilet to dry and change which is less than satisfactory (other people dripped along the carpeted corridor and got into the lift creating quite a puddle) 
There's a hidden Walmart across the sky bridge on the 6th floor - just cross the car park. It is screened by trees.

I would most definitely stay again in this hotel, it is delightful and the best Best Western I have ever stayed in (and most have been very good) For the views alone it is worth a visit.

Positives

Negatives
> awful air conditioning setup: blows aggressively on one's head while in bed. So bad that it had to be turned off on a hot day...simply awful
> The desk had one (dim!)  light and no place to plug in (110 volt) unless you crawled under the desk. Even cheap hotels provide lamps  with outlets or some type of power strip on the desk.

Grounds were reasonable, had a shaded seating area and a small pool
 
I did see a few people hanging around at the edge of the parking lot but they didn't hassle anyone.

It is a good central location near freeways. And near a variety of fast food and casual restaurants.

903190789_15319209,"Rose to expectations At first blush, the hotel felt a little tired.  Our room was back in a corner with the only window looking out on a tiny alley/wall with barbed wire.  No other rooms were available and since we were only staying two nights, we settled. The room itself was very nice but needed more than one chair in which to relax, read, etc.  Then we laid down on the spectacular bed and the best pillows we’ve yet to find in any hotel.  We had one of the best burgers and fries in the bar with the friendliest bartender. Room service was on request only, which we didn’t ask for, and yet they came in both days…nice.  So, in the future, we’ll book earlier and get a room on the street side to enjoy the sunshine.  Yes, we will be coming back.",7/15/23

Keydi in particular went out of her way to give a wonderful experience  every morning. She even went out of her way to make sure my husband and I had eggs that accommodated our no pork diet restriction. She’s the best! I also love that the location was across the street from the Asheville outlets, which was convenient when we wanted to do some last minute shopping. We’ll definitely be back the next time we visit Asheville.",9/2/23

877983353_674985,"Stay was great The stay was great. The bed was very comfortable and the staff was very nice. However, the breakfast is another story. Since the hotel is going through renovations, the breakfast is in one of the meeting rooms. We got downstairs about 8:15. There were only a few pieces of bacon left, over done eggs and there was a skin on the gravy. The only positive thing is the banana was good. Whoever was supposed to maintain the breakfast food, was not doing a very good job of keeping it fresh. We have reservations in two weeks and hopefully the breakfast will be different.",2/8/23
867693002_23901017,"Amazing experience and I WILL return! I spent  4 amazing nights at Secrets Moxche in a preferred club jr suite ocean view suite.  I knew it was still a pretty new resort so figured they would have some issues to work out. I was wrong!  It was absolutely spectacular! The suite was gorgeous, the pools were  all so unique and a different vibe. The natural wood/stone theme of the resort was just so sleek and beautiful.  Beach is very pretty and a natural feel.  The restaurant choices were great and our dining experiences were all very good.  Great bars and tremendous service all around.  Everywhere you look its just so beautiful. The one thing that most resorts lack is good entertainment.  Not Secrets Moxche.  I was so impressed with their entertainment team who did an amazing job getting everyone to the fantastic shows and the hidden speak easy ""Gypsy Club"" after.  So huge shout out to Carlos and Rodrigo!  They were fantastic.  Also shout out to Daniella in sales.  This resort is worth another visit and I can't wait to return.",11/8/22

868908556_651575,"Mixed emotions about this place. The rooms are very average and ""motel like"", unless if you're staying in the Tower. Room cleaning isnt a daily practice and needs pre booking. Excellent area for kids to play in with slides etc. There is also another pool in the middle of the resort which has normally got bits of leaves and other stuff from trees floating about. It does get cleaned but just not often enough. There is a complimentary service to Universal Studios which goes to many hotels before you get to the destination. Timings of these buses are not great as last bus leaves Universal two hours before park closure which is pointless. That bus is normally packed and no standing room.
In terms of location, it's in an excellent place. You have many restaurants, shops within walking distance. There are iRide bus stops outside the hotel. Staff are nice but very proactive, you literally need to tell them what you want. There are other slightly more classier hotels you can stay in...",11/18/22

Quiet room on the 15th floor with a city view. Comfortable bed and TV worked well. 

Only problem was that the heat did not work and a cold front was moving through. Front desk offered to send a technician but we were ready for bed when we realized the issue and chose to just crawl under the covers. 

Check out very quickly done with a very friendly Hilton employee who also promised to have the heating issue fixed right away.",5/1/23

Our room was a little small and definitely needed some work.  The carpet was worn/stained and the hutch that held the microwave and fridge was broken at the bottom.  It was very clean....maybe too clean.  The smell of disinfectant was very strong. Fortunately, it dissipated after awhile.

The hotel has a small pool that looked well maintained.  The breakfast was better than average for most Hamptons.  The food was fresh and there was some fruit, which is much appreciated.

With a little work, this could be a top notch property",5/23/23

The rooms are spacious, comfortable, and quiet, but need updating. The bathrooms especially need to be updated. There was no fan in our bathroom, which made the air uncomfortably hot when showering, and the toilet handle had to be held down long when flushing. The breakfast was good with hot eggs and sausages, but waffles, muffins, yogurt, etc. were all packaged. Complimentary ice cream treats, chips, and soda every night is a nice treat, especially for families with kids! The staff was all very friendly and professional. We would stay here again and recommend it.",6/22/23

A lot of the rooms have been updated and are very comfortable. I can't rave enough about the staff. Everyone was helpful and offered service with a smile. 
Surge pricing for U of O events puts the hotel in the $$$ range, but over all the convenience and service balance out the cost.
If you are traveling to Euegene on holiday or for business, I'd still recommend this hotel. It's located pretty conveniently to get around all of Eugene. The pool looks nice so during the summer it would be fun for kids. 
Depending on where you stay in the hotel, road noise during event weekends is a tiny issue at night. We stayed on the second floor near the road during homecoming weekend.  Overall I'd still give this hotel 5 stars for the comfort of the room, the service, and the incredible staff.",10/27/23

This is a fairly new hotel and this type of quality was sorely needed in town. It's set back a bit farther from the freeway, so even the parking lot is fairly quiet. It's an easy short drive into town. 
Although we did not bring our dog, they welcome pets. They also have a very pleasant grassy 'back yard' area for kids to play, and a nice fireplace/patio area as well. The pool is indoor, although a bit small, it is open - unlike many other lodgings which did not reopen their pools after the Covid shutdown.

The hallways of the hotel are dreary, and both elevator floors have cracks in the tiles, which are covered up by filthy rugs.  You can feel the cracks when you stand on them.

Every staff member was generous with their time and acted most professionally. Above all, they met every request (including my own for extra towels) with the same demeanor. Rooms are larger than most hotel and this low budget price point and most every local attraction is in about a 2-8 minute walk!

Its a landmark hotel. Nothing fancy but with old world charm.

PROS

-Friendly staff. No problems communicating or getting help from them.

-Centrally located. Right in the commercial district, though it has seen better times. Pike Place is less than 5 mins away and the subway and monorail are right around the corner. large Bartells convenience store less than a minute away as well. Very close to the convention center as well. 

- The room had TWO (2) bathrooms! (See cons though) 

- Free bottled water and coffee.

CONS

-Internet was spotty. One the 10th floor it was completely unreliable but on the 12th it was more than adequate.

I spent many hours in the hospital and driving to and from Dallas. Walking in the door in the late afternoon (exhausted from the Dallas-to-Fort Worth commute) to my clean room and the friendly staff was the highlight of my day. The front desk staff (especially Michelle) were so incredibly kind, and that made a difference in my days. Housekeeping did a wonderful job, and coming back to a clean room with fresh sheets and towels made my stay a lot more comfortable. The surgery was a trying experience for me and my family, and having this quiet, comfortable space was just the restorative and calm experience I needed. Also worth mentioning is that my room didn't have the ""hotel smell"" that you get sometimes. My room always smelled lightly fresh to neutral. Pillows and sheets were so soft, too! I thought I would be tired of living in a hotel after 26 nights, but I honestly was sad to leave and could have stayed longer. I definitely would recommend this place!",10/29/22

I had never been to the area before.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  The rooms were clean, bed and pillows comfortable (very important, and I am very picky as I travel every week for work). The best part was the young man who works the front desk (i forgot to write his name down, but he started his shift at 3p on oct 3rd).  He was the friendliest, most helpful, sweet front desk person I have ever encountered since traveling for work the past 5 years.  He gave restaurant recommendations, made a fresh pot of coffee in the afternoon, had utensils ready for when they’re not included in deliveries….. just wonderful.

We only had a reservation for one night but we found ourselves in need of the room for a second night and the front desk staff were really great about not only booking us in for another night, but ensuring we would keep the room we were in.  There were a few negatives. The pool was drained and closed so that was a bit disappointing.  The breakfast had a good variety of hot and cold items, though they did seem to have trouble keeping things stocked.  Road noise was somewhat loud on the side of the hotel we were on as well.

However, the way the pool area is located, you can grab a chair right up against the sea wall overlooking the ocean, and you can walk down a set of stairs directly adjacent to that area and immediately be in the water. My wife and I are big ""beach"" people, but this situation did not effect our experience in the slightest. 
The rooms at the resort are clean, the beds are comfy and the restaurants and bars were top notch. 
What REALLY made our vacation at this resort a resounding success though, were the hotel employees. Everyone was amazing. The most friendly and helpful resort employees that we have ever experienced.

Water pressure was nice. The bathroom was a little rough. There were cracks in the walls and the grouting around the shower was not so appealing. The pool was not open, very disappointing. The lobby needs a lot of work. There were water stains on the walls and the large mountain display was pretty rough. In all fairness, it did appear that a slight remodel was happening. However, I would’ve like to have known that before making my reservation. I was informed that if you go to the LAST page of information, where it says “other information” I might have noticed that the pool was not open. 😳 Suggestion: READ EVERYTHING, even if you think you don’t need to.

The rooms are always clean and ready to occupy at the proscribed time and the housekeeping staff is always ready to help if needed.  One biggie for us is the breakfast.  This hotel consistently has a great breakfast and several choices to choose from.  In a lot of hotels, Hamptons included, this has not been the case lately.

The front check in ladies were very personable and so nice. Their names were Ms Marlo and Ms Nyosha.  They made us feel at home. 
Then the next morning the ladies that took care of breakfast was so very friendly and the food was prepared very nicely and Ms Helen did a great job taking care of the food and when their was no more coffee Ms Penny apologized for it and jumped in action and even asked could she bring coffee to our table 
And then before we left she apologized again and asked if we wanted fruit or cake to take with us.   So very friendly it made a big impression on me because I’ve never seen anyone care so much at any job.  
We went to check out and her name was Ms Tannesha who was nice also.  

If I was Hampton Inn I would reward these employees and be very proud you have so many employees who care.  I would highly recommend this place and definitely when I come back to Atlanta to see a game I will stay there again!!",9/28/23

ONLY negative is the unfortunate resort fees, only thing you get are free wifi, calls & gym, but computer on 2nd floor you have to pay for internet/computer use plus 50cents per copy.

My major complaint was the noise.  I was kept awake almost all night by the traffic on I-81.  We had a room in the front of the hotel and it was probably only 100 feet from the interstate.  The trucks did not stop until 1:00 AM and started back up at 6:00.  I had the fan on ""constant"" to try to drown out the noise, but it did not work.

If you stay here ask for a room on the backside of the hotel as far away from the interstate as possible .I don't know if it will be any quieter, but it might be worth trying.",9/27/22

And I’ve never felt the need to write a review for a hotel before now. The level of service far exceeded my expectations. At breakfast the continental breakfast not only had a great selection but was also surprisingly delicious. Then one person offered to clear my empty plate for me and not in the way where I felt like they were trying to get rid of me. Someone else offered bottled water a little later. Then I’m the evening there was a small platter of cookies and they went back boiled tea water to make sure I had a nice hot cup of tea. Hope the staff get recognized for their exceptional service as they definitely deserve it. Will stay here again without hesitation next time I’m in town!,10/17/23

We were walking back to our hotel and got caught in a rainstorm so popped into the Hotel for shelter.

I remember it had a great hotel gift shop so we went to browse and make a purchase. Lisa, I hope I remembered her name correctly, was delightful. So friendly and helpful and great knowledge about the products.

It was still raining when we left and initially she offered us an umbrella to use and then she spoke to one of the bellman and said she had arranged a ride back to our hotel. How unexpected and delightful. It was less than 1/2 mile back to our Hotel but we would have been soaked.

Derek drove us back. He was so nice and engaging.

It really was a wonderful service experience and next time we are in Sarasota we hope to return to this Hotel.

We were gone the entire day  and came back to the room. We found that the bloody sheet was still there! I called the front desk again and was again told that house keeping was gone for the day.

Overall, the room was gross and we had to change the bedding ourselves. We were told that no one would come clean the room during our stay, and they didn’t. It would have been nice if they made an exception to clean our room since it wasn’t cleaned before our stay. However, no one ever came to clean it.

The woman working at night was very nice and helpful with giving us clean bedding. She was friendly every time we went down to the lobby at night. She definitely made this experience better. 

The people staying above us ran and jumped around at all hours of the day until around midnight. It was very loud and made it hard to sleep or relax.

I avoided the whole experience of breakfast, grabbed a banana and got out of there. The staff at the desk was friendly.  Room seem clean enough, just depressing. Will never stay here again.",3/8/23

The bedding was dirty and did not appear washed. There were not enough pillows for the number of people in my family. The floor and carpet were disgusting. The room smelled; there was hair in the tub and the heating and air conditioning units did not work. The front desk was not helpful. It was a miserable stay as the conditions were disgusting. The clumps of hair in the pool area made me want to vomit and I would not let my kids swim.,4/11/23

The balcony door had structural defects -- it cut 2 of my toe fingers 1/4"" deep when I tied to close it. There are sharp metals extended from the bottom of the door, there is a gap between bottom edge & floor and the door does not stop at obstacle in its path. 
Had to wait 20min for nurse, who put a shoddy bandage because there was not enough supplies. She cut my foot again when I went to replace the dressing the next day.  

I was limping with bandaged toe 2 days of my stay, could not enjoy any water activity or go to beach (which btw are the main attractions) during these 2 days. 

The manager rep (O’Donnell Barnett) was completely unsympathetic, combative, condescending -- I felt insulted after speaking with him. He used the term “user error” to imply the incident was my fault. The conversation totally ruined my holiday mood for the rest of the stay. Asked me to submit an incident report, which I did -- haven't heard from them yet.

There was also viable crumbs and dirt in the corners of the bathroom. Night stand had to be wiped off before using.

The good interaction: The front desk immediately had the door lock fixed for one of my son's rooms immediately. Room 122 I believe.
The bad interaction: In my room there were 2 dirty pillow cases and a bottle of cleaning solution left on one of the night stand (not good if little children were present). The housekeeping lady come into my room, looked right at me, we both said Hi and then she started cleaning even though I was in bed. Since she wasn't leaving to give me privacy to get ready, I had to quickly and secretly dress while she was in the bathroom replacing the towels.

I finally got to my final room  the shower had hair and grime. I slept in my sweat shirt and leggings just to feel comfortable. It was a waste of my 20,000 points and frankly my time all together.

The breakfast buffet was the better of most new HGI's where we've stayed recently,  with the fresh cut fruit, yoghurt, cereals, bread,etc. We ordered vegi omelet and French Toasts with bacon. Both dishes were well presented and perfect to our taste, such that my wife went to the kitchen counter to compliment the chef on both mornings., Our hostess, Tabitha was terrific, cheerful and friendly, and knows what real service means.

Room was very nice, pool area a bit noisy, very full of spring breakers and others from outside as there was a pool event going on.  Didn't really bother us though.  The only downfall is that they allow anyone to use the pools and they kind of take over.
Also the pool closes at 6 so we were not able to enjoy any cocktails before our dinner reservations.  Before covid they had happy our appetizers which were great.

I had spa services, and the spa's hostess at the front desk was excellent. She was welcoming and efficient and answered questions when I scheduled my appointment, reassuring me the person providing me service was terrific. And he was. Alex is why I'll be booking a Spa Intercontinental soon. 

Lastly, I encountered a slight issue (of my own making) when I was leaving. Mia Davis, in the parking garage/valet office alone, is enough reason to return to the Intercontinental Buckhead again and again.

Maybe booking through Expedia made it confusing for them.  Our room had wet carpet and an odd smell.  The sink had no drain, making it difficult for contact lens wearers.  We slept well though, so maybe that's all you need in a hotel.  Nice bed and pillows.  Breakfast was super basic but I did have a good waffle!",11/10/23

At bed time I saw my blanket was dirty with lipstick on the inside part of it and the towels had hair on them, but one of the biggest issues we had, was on the second day we were there we left in the morning and of course locked the door, they had someone go fix the Tv and upon leaving did not actually closed the door. We came back later at night to our door open. We were thankful our valuables were still in the room, but they could have been gone!

After making reservation on-line weeks before for a room with roll in shower and at check in the front desk staff confirmed roll in shower, we went to assigned room. It had a tub with a few grab bars. Went back to front desk where initially they said WE reserved the wrong room. After about 15 minutes assigned us another room. Now being late for a scheduled dinner elsewhere, we left luggage in initial room to move after we got back from a dinner. 
The new handicap accessible room did have roll in shower, but thermostat mounted too high on wall to read and adjust. Bathroom commode surrounded by dividing wall that prevented side tranfer from wheelchair. Flush handle difficult to reach from wheelchair.
They have installed square towel rods to act as grab bars which are not very study and surely violate ADA regulations.

The hotel really needs updating and the sheets/towels were low quality and worn. The hotel is billed as a lake view, but it overlooks a highway and the lake is far off in the distance. The toilet didn't flush well and the frig cabinet door scraped the floor when opened. We had just come from a BW at the Grand canyon that was very well kept up and had an extremely comfortable room.

It feels just like your crack addicted neighbors opening drawers and pacing their room at 4 am are right in the room with you!

Other amenities include bedsheets with sandpaper-like texture that help to exfoliate while you sleep.  The height of luxury!  

With a budget $70 price tag this hotel is a steal- usually you have to pay double that price to actually feel angry at a hotel for not living up to expectations.

The room was awkward, and not overly pleasant.  The TV in front of the bed is small and placed low on the cabinet, lower than the bed. You can't prop yourself up to be able to watch it properly either because the pillows are absurdly big but extremely soft. The bed is nothing worth mentioning. 

The cabinet door holding the fridge/microwave  needs to be fixed.

If there is a safety box, I was unable to find it.

( I had already had a disgusting experience in Dallas two weeks previously and which Hilton never took care of my problem and I am a Hilton honors member ) Instead, we had to call the police. 
The best part of our stay were the people at the front desk. They were so embarrassed over everything that was happening. . 
The room was dirty. The towels were stained  the people next-door were having a party loud music the TV was on. .  For HOURS. 
To top it all off we were on the bottom floor and a vehicle backed up to our window, where a really drunk couple proceeded to open up the back of the SUV. Turn on the music and retrieve booze. The man was so drunk he about fell down 2 to 3 times.. 
After about one hour, I called the police and met them outside  .
Nothing was done. We were up most of the night dealing with this .
We told Hilton and they never ever did anything empty promises we will comp a  room we will give you your money back nothing .  Do
NOT stay here .
I would never recommend this hotel to anyone .",4/12/23

The room configurations are such that a room will be situated with a next door neighbor you’ll hear sniffling, and more. No offense to the help but the room cleaners are not clean themselves. We had two teenage boys cleaning our 1 room ( we did change during our stay.) In fairness the people at the front desk are nice and try hard, but they can’t invest the money to improve the old dump. They can’t wash the walls, Re carpet the place, clean out the ventilation system. I think the place was probably something in its day.. that day being the 1940’s. Board of Health should have stepped in long ago . The owner of this place is seemingly putting not a penny in it. It’s the kind of place you put up with if your car breaks down on the interstate. At $350+ a night, it’s thievery.",8/7/23

The staff cares but there is only so much they can do, the place is run down.
That said the Downtown area is becoming more upscale and this hotel needs to follow along. 
The location is great, however the rooms have been bled dry, it is in desperate need of a renovation. Few items in the rooms work, I mean ancient televisions, non working desk lights and other lamps.
It is as clean as it can be but don’t notice the ceilings that have been patched and patched, the wallpaper coming off the walls and patched.
The elevator key “to use it” system is turned off.
It’s just sad because it could be such a nice place with an investment of money into it.

When we got to our room, the room felt even more tired. It smelled vaguely of body odour and the walls were thin, allowing us to hear our neighbours’ conversations.

The window shade the blocks out light will not raise more than roughly two feet. I guess that is better than not being able to use it. We only have a view of a fence so that doesn't matter.

Upon further inspection, we found a fly and a lady bug.  Later, we found another lady bug and a stink bug.  Then I found another stink bug in the bathroom.  I disposed of the stink bugs.

We decided to try a different place this weekend.  We should had cancelled at checkin your front desk staff was very rude and unprofessional!

We requested early check in and we're told we could check in at noon for $50 ok fine but when we arrived at 12:10 they told us it is not available so then at 12:35 they said it was available now and the fee would be $50 for early check in!

Well we did not get our room at noon as told when making reservations!   They made us wait until 1:00 and still had to pay $25 !
My husband has health conditions and that is why we requested early check in!

The curtain was hanging off the rod;  hair on the sheets; toilet had mold; faucet had caked on lime build up; mold around the ceiling in the bathroom: and tv screen was very greasy.

The best feature is the huge breakfast area in the lobby. Lots of tables so you can always find a place to sit even at busiest times. 6 (count 'em) waffle makers and really fast commercial toasters. Food is average quality, but it's included in the price of your room!

884846999_676095,"Came for the Location: Stayed for the Service We were visiting family in Canonsburg and Washington with the occasional trip to Pittsburgh. The location is convenient to everything in Canonsburg and Washington. 
The rooms were generous in size, included a refrigerator, microwave, and coffee machine. The room temperature was consistent, the bed was comfortable and the shower was hot. We slept well and did not hear any other neighbors even though the parking lot was full. 
I used the gym every morning to lift weights and found the gym to be fine for my needs. I also used the jacuzzi which was relaxing before going to bed. 
The complimentary breakfast was better than most hotels. There was always an egg option and usually sausage, Biscuits and Gravy, Oatmeal, Yoplait, toast, bagels, muffins, juice, milk, coffee, decaf, tea, and the ever famous waffle machine (YUM). I left every morning feeling like a I had a good breakfast to start the day. While you are close to several restaurants, I never considered going anywhere for breakfast except the lobby. 
I would definitely stay here again as I plan my next trip to the Canonsburg/Washington area. Price-wise, I thought this was a great value.",4/4/23

The pool had rocks and big chunks of bark in it. Hot tub was dirty with yellow bubbles. The breakfast was awful! Powdered eggs, over cooked Canadian bacon. Laundry was next door at the Cortana......dirty and scary not to mention $4.00 to wash and $4.00 to dry. We had a four night reservation but checked out after the second night.

The hotel lobby, elevator, and hallways smelled of cigarette smoke. The rooms and the property itself are in need of updating. The pool was broken for repair and based on other reviews it has been this way for some time. The hotel charges $3 for parking which is laughable as the parking lot is in disrepair and adjacent to a bowling alley in a suburban setting.

1) The name of the hotel. Is it The Gates Hotel, 24 North or, a combo of both?   
2) The drain in our bathroom sink was very slow. 
3) Both the gym & the pool were supposed to be open @ 6:00 A.M. They were not.
4) The T.V. can't be heard unless the volume is at 70 or more & it kept losing signal. Ugh.
5) The coffee maker does not produce HOT coffee. Thank goodness for the microwave. 
6) The A/C was set on 69 and couldn't be changed.
7) The only garbage can in the joint was in the bathroom. 
8) We had to push hard on the door to get it to open.

The pool was very comfortable to swim in and smelled strongly of chlorine.  We also used the hot tub.  The temperature was probably around 101-102.  Not scalding but very comfortable.  The towels at the hotel were very small and rough.  The reason I gave this hotel only 2 stars was that i was unable to take a hot shower either night we were there.  The water was a cool tepid at best.  I reported this to the front dest but nothing was done about it.  The temperature control was confusing so i tried the water in what I thought was both the hot then the cold settings for a few minutes each and got cool water at best.,1/13/23

We had high hopes for the pool but it left a lot to be desired. The pebbles were hard on the feet to walk and the pool, although well vacuumed, needed some TLC. We had wanted to spend two days, but cut our trip short because it wasn't a place that you wanted to spend much time at. Our hotel floor looked to have old vomit on the carpet in the hallway. I mentioned something to the manager, and he seemed appalled, but nothing was done to clean the carpet while we were there.  One of the women staying with us opted to run to Target and buy pillows and sheets for herself and her daughter.

Thehallways were dirty and smelled like rotten eggs.  The rooms were not clean (crumbs on the floor, cracks on the walls and ceilings).  We ventured down to the pool area to find the area smelling of urine.  The hot tub was not full or operational and the water was yellow.  Attempted to shower but the tub area was raining ants from the ceiling from the humidity of the water. 

Spoke with a different gentleman on the morning of our departure asking for the manager's name and was refused the information.  He stated he was new and didn't have that information.

When we were in the room we realized all of the appliances(tv, coffee maker, microwave, refrigerator) were all plugged into a small power strip. Walking through the halls there was cardboard taped over doors and strong smell or Marijuana. We were told the pool incident was simply chemicals cooking without water, like that was no big deal. We booked a new room at AVID ( ACROSS THE STREET FOR THE EXACT SAME PRICE!!!). When we left I asked for a refund, I was told by the girl behind the desk who asked the other woman what to do, that they would cancel our charges. 4 days later, we still have the charges on our card.

We did borrow bikes that were in terrible shape and made for a very exciting and wobbly bike ride. Our condo was part of the private rental pool and was not equipped for six people. The kitchen didn't have enough plates and cooking utensils, the oven didn't really work, and housekeeping was sporadic (no housekeeping for a five day stretch).

My flight home was late and the staff allowed me to use the pool and garden area instead of spending the day at the airport.  The shuttle wasn't running that day and they called me a complimentary Lyft ride to the airport.  They held my luggage and would not even accept a tip.  Hats off to Veronica at the front desk and all of the friendly staff.  I will definitely stay again the next time I cruise or fly out of Miami.  Also, the rooms are very large and overlook a small lake.",11/9/23

We didn’t have a bad meal, or drink, the entire stay. We were in a Preferred Club Ocean Front Suite and while we loved the rooftop pool and Observatory for meals, didn’t like that Preferred Club didn’t garner a high floor in the resort. We learned our lesson and will ask again in the future. Strongly recommend you take mosquito repellent (although they have natural repellent in the restaurants) for eating outdoors.

The staff was very friendly and accommodating throughout our stay. I very much enjoyed the pool but highly disappointed that there was no jacuzzi as advertised and the sauna was out of order. I found this very annoying because I booked the Southpark mainly for those things.

However, we specifically picked this hotel because they had told us that they had a working car charger. We had an electric vehicle for our stay, so it was important to us to be able to have a place to charge and start the day with a full battery. When we arrived, we found out that their charger (a standard J1772) does not work with Tesla vehicles. Huh? The staff told us that they knew of this problem, and there were no plans to fix it. So instead of a relaxing stay, we woke up every day stressing about having to make time to run over to a supercharger. Definitely won't be back.",9/12/23

We love the pool, the beds are comfortable, the area has wonderful restaurants, and the nature hikes behind the property are excellent. The Equinox has plenty of space to wander indoors as well with comfy couches and chairs for reading, drawing, maybe napping? I love the steam room and sauna, though both need a little TLC these days. Last winter they had an arcade which we really enjoyed, and with summer days—we've enjoyed their lawn games and outdoor firepit. The rates can be reasonable and we will quite likely return.",8/21/23

The water literally comes up to the hotel so the only place you can lay on a chair to take the sun is around the pool area and overlooking the water. They have about 1/4 the amount of chairs to accommodate all people staying at the hotel. Expect to have to get up at 6:30 to go down to get chairs and find you were just lucky enough to get the last three chairs squeezed in in front of the restaurant that will be given to someone else when you go for an hour long massage.

Our room had a balcony , it was lovely watching the fireworks in the evening or sitting with a coffee .
We made use of the free drink vouchers , free hot drinks in the morning and juice in the afternoon , just in the lobby .

The ballrooms and meeting rooms were nice and the staff serving the catered meals were professional, helpful and friendly. The catered meals were not my fave and the one greens dish should be banned. I had my allergy listed and somehow still got food that set off a reaction as almost all the lunch options had walnuts in it. I thought the mattresses, blankets and pillows were fabulous. I also liked the shower set up and the scent of the shampoo and other products.

If it were my 1st experience with the chain it would be my last. The minute we walked into our room we were greeted by a large red stain on the carpet and multiple other stains. The couch was saggy and has seen better days. The floor to ceiling closet mirrors in the bathroom were smudged and dirty. The furniture in the main room was sticky and dirty. The shower drain was mostly clogged so by time you took a quick shower you were standing in half a tub of water. The pool water was cloudy and murky. The booth /banquet seating in the bar / breakfast area was also covered in stains. This hotel needs to be throughly cleaned and fabric / carpet replaced.

The beach area was lovely super clean, chilled,  no crazy woo-woo crowd or loud music. 

Rooms were ok. Comfy beds and a large shower.  Not the most modern of a room and not up to my usual expectations at this price point, no smart TV, a/c not that cold. We were only here for 2 nights so these are things I could live with.

Overall, my stay was fine.  Check in was fast (no one else there at 11:30pm).  Breakfast was good - I had the buffet each morning. There was also a Starbucks in the lobby.  

There wasn't much else to say about this property.  It was very quiet at night - not many people were in the restaurant and there wasn't much of a vibe at the bar.  The neighborhood was mostly corporate offices and other hotels.  There are a few restaurants near the freeway within walking distance - we ate at the Mexican restaurant, which was good.

The climate control in the room was loud and ineffective. The room was chilly.

We had to request sheets for the fold out bed.  We only recieved a top sheet. No cover.

There were only enough towels in the room for one person. Three of us were staying. We had to request towels.

This was perfect for our visit as we didn't spend much time at hotel, picked for price and vantage point to many things.  Spent cost differential with other hotels on great meals on the island.

Pros: GREAT location, can walk to The Bank beer garden, Coligny plaza, beach, a park across the street and other restaurants.  We also biked to many places. Room was quiet despite being next to ice machine & elevator, we heard nothing and usually this is my chief complaint. Price good comparatively. Parking free and easy.

Cons: Does not have a 'resort' feel to it if you are looking for that. Rooftop bar area a bit sleepy, perhaps more lively in the summer. No real views or balcony, etc. Room was clean, furniture, desk, etc. had a bit of knicks and marks despite hotel only a few years old.

This was our first Wyndham hotel stay and it was a different hotel stay than typically see.  Older property but very clean.  Our room was very roomy and comfortable.  

I had voiced concern with outside access not working and they responded they were waiting on replacement parts.   I think I would prefer the door be locked and a sign posted stating would be locked at dark.

The area was easy to get too from highways and no charge to park.  Benihana on location as well as a steak house.  There was a high school reunion the night we stayed so lots of activity.

1. The hotel offered free Uber service to the Opryland hotel as their tram service was not running. We took the Uber first thing in the morning and stayed at the conference until 5:30PM. When we called the Hyatt front desk, we were informed that the Uber service stopped at 5:00PM. No one had told us this before hand, otherwise we would have made other arrangements. We ended up paying for our own Uber ride back to the hotel.

2. We requested housekeeping twice using the online app. Housekeeping showed up a day later than expected the first time and didn't show up at all the second time.

After numerous exchanges with ACCOR customer service and follow-up emails with the Hotel, this one and the customer service of ACCOR did not answer my request formulated according to the conditions defined by ACCOR obliging me either to accept to pay the high price from 25 October or to lose a night since from 25 October the cancellation conditions were to have to pay the first night. It is clear that neither the hotel nor ACCOR intended to implement this clause.
I denounce here a more than dubious commercial practice and recommend neither to book in this hotel nor to believe in the clause of best price guaranteed on the site of ACCOR.

Our first room was terrible. Looked as if someone had slept in the bed, spilled coffee or ??? all over the top bedding and also the sheets had stains. The chair had what looked to be a mucus smear and the room smelled like dirty clothes.

The SECOND ROOM was dirty. Again bed looked wrinkled and slept in, but no stains this time. Didn't bother with the chair. The hand towel was visibly dirty and my husband used it to clean up the PEE on the floor in the bathroom. Room was smelly and musty - like the first. We were so tired, we just slept in our clothes on top of the VERY UNCOMFORTABLE BED. 

Check in staff was wonderful. But this property is tired and unless it makes significant changes I would never recommend staying at this La Quinta!",3/27/23

The third room (928) which I kept was small and outdated, although it had a lovely view of the marina. the bathroom door pushed out to the tiny hallway so you could never pass by without completely shutting the door.

The shade on the hanging light fixture in our room was broken and hanging strangely, and the lighting in the room overall was truly insufficient. Furnishings were average - nothing fancy but a passable place to spend the night. Beds were comfortable and bedding was clean, but I'm not sure I would recommend staying here based on the unreliability of web booking.",5/1/23

I understand that Hilton Garden Inn doesn’t guarantee upgrades for elites, but they often do so when rooms are available. A better room was available. It still is as I write this review. 

Why did she lie to me? Maybe she didn’t feel like typing in her computer and doing the work of reassigning my room.

When I reported the issue during checkout, the employee seemed to think that it wasn't the responsibility of the hotel employees to be monitoring the conditions of spaces in the building such as the exercise room.

For examples...
In the guest room the carpets seem well work, the couch surface well worn, the edges of furniture pieces rubbed off and dinged up.  The toilet paper holder was literally falling off the wall.... it had brand new rolls with their cover paper still on them, so someone in housekeeping had just seen this condition, but moved on.

There were 6 in our group and we had 3 rooms. The lobby & breakfast area is small - capacity? Maybe 10,  breakfast is very limited and they have a small selection of awful looking frozen meals you can microwave if you are desperate. 2 of our 6 person group returned home  with rashes and bites consistent with bed bug infestation. Separate rooms, different floors, same diagnosis. Gross - even by ‘guy standards’ which in our case were low, but you would think that $250/night might get you better than motel standards in a slum.

The room was dirty. The towels were stained  the people next-door were having a party loud music the TV was on. .  For HOURS. 
To top it all off we were on the bottom floor and a vehicle backed up to our window, where a really drunk couple proceeded to open up the back of the SUV. Turn on the music and retrieve booze. The man was so drunk he about fell down 2 to 3 times.. 
After about one hour, I called the police and met them outside  .

The Avid also provided a nice breakfast in the morning - continental style breakfast - but nice, good coffee. The only downside was that the hotel was in an Industrial area.  You could walk a few blocks to get a bite to eat but you had to cross a large, busy highway with no pedestrian crossings.  We meet a very nice lady, Elizabeth, who was manning the front desk while we were there.  Super friendly and helpful.",11/28/22

The bathroom had a tub with a seat, instead of a walk in shower, and the controls for the hand held shower head were not installed correctly.  This meant my friend could not reach them, so didn't have the chance to shower.  Breakfast looked good,, but we ate elsewhere.

When you add the bigger rooms, the good breakfast, the reception, and the overall quality experience it’s one of the best stays you can get. Recommend a balcony, but make sure it’s a high floor, as the other reviews have stated the fans are a bit of a pain but if you’re high up, it’s fine. The rooftop restaurant and bar is also pretty cool. There are a number of options downtown but this is a winner.

The beach was beautiful. The food was great with good selection. Any alcoholic beverage you could ask for whenever you wanted. Service staff was amazing. Very hard workers, friendly and there to make your stay a wonderful experience!

The Level had benefits we appreciated including: upper level oceanfront views, reserved use of “bali beds” on the beach or poolside (basically cabanas), reservations at the restaurants (a nice break from the buffet), best seating at the buffet and super concierge service. They even had change for our larger peso bills. The Level also gave you a coupon for the spa which  I was happy to use!

This place has lots of entertainment available but we didn’t take advantage of it except for the music one night. There were planned activities daily. They have tennis courts, basketball and croquet too. There were kids there but there is an adults only pool which we appreciated. 

There are birds everywhere and they are fun to watch. Also look for the resident iguanas, especially as they jump off the roof of the Fish House into the pond.",1/29/23

My wife and I made reservations for two nights and were pleasantly surprised and impressed by the accommodations. The lounge and restaurant on-site were excellent and we enjoyed breakfast and dinner both days.

Breakfast selection had just about anything a person young or elderly would enjoy on their buffet. A variety of well prepared fresh fruit, a tremendous meat and egg selection along with breakfast sweet rolls and biscuits. Plenty of fresh juices and coffee.

Dinner selections were also in a wide range from salad's, pizza  to prime rib and quality steaks. We enjoyed petite fillet's with loaded baked potatoes one night. The fillets were prepared to perfection. The second evening we decided on fish & chips with a fresh Caesar salad while watching Thursday night NFL.

The room itself was good and newly remodeled.  The room smelled a little perfumey, beds were comfy enough for a good nights rest. Breakfast the next morning was good and plentiful. 

My main complaint was the pool was closed for our stay. John did go above and beyond to get us access if we wanted to another hotel's pool which was amazing. We ended up playing cards all night in the lobby area which was beautifully designed. Overall a nice stay.

The updates that were done to hotel make it more modern with a traditional feel. We enjoyed the outdoor patio. Breakfast was yummy and the coffee was good too (I am kind of a coffee snob). 

Our room was updated in decor. It could use some updates to the doors and popcorn paint (which I know is common in this area of VA). Pillows were ample, not as comfortable as I would prefer. 

We were able to secure rooms next door to our friends. We did make that request at the time of reservation.  Staff was kind and accommodating.

I would definitely recommend!",6/11/23

865709905_1413491,"Met expectations on short notice stay Did not have sofa throw pillows & missing paint chips on the exec desk, large king was comfy. Rough toilet paper but overall nice, but met my room placement request and put me as far away from the elevator as possible. Rooms were not huge but did have the large king beds as an option which I prefer over two Queen beds. Good short notice hotel stay with great hot breakfast in the morning, and Starbucks coffee on for the day. A small bar by the front desk and plenty of tables and lounge areas in the lobby for those times you are waiting on others to join. Parking is in the back, accessed with your card and is a daily charge but the incidentals charges are minimal. It’s not top luxury but I have stayed in many of the hotels in SLC and this one didn’t disappoint as much as some of their larger competitors have. It’s easy to find and honestly, a little peaceful gem in the middle of the city if you don’t have a need for a kitchen in the room.",10/23/22

He was very helpful, informative, super friendly & made us feel right at home.

Pretty good proximity to things, but the area immediately surrounding the W is pretty bad - I realize that is out of their control.  Hotel lobby has typical W buzz, staff was friendly for us.  In particular the valets were very nice and helpful.  Our room was fine, it wasn't as run down as a lot of reviewers have reported.  We were a little hot in the room though.  Bar was nice.  The club had a 100 person line on Saturday night but we never heard any noise, and slept well.  

Lots of doormen keeping out the unsavory lot from around the area, and the elevators require a key card, which is nice.  The homeless issue on Hollywood Blvd. is for real.

We had a delicious breakfast at the hotel one morning. The Miraflores location was in a lovely, quiet, clean neighborhood. We enjoyed the walk to Barranca from the hotel.

Every person we encountered from valet to check out was incredibly friendly and helpful.  They truly made us feel special.  The grounds are beautiful and the bar is great.  We stayed in four Fairmonts during our trip and Lake Louise was by far the best - much, much better than Benff Springs.  We had the breakfast buffet and it was phenomenal.  My advice - limit overnight stay in Banff and head up to Lake Louise instead.   I wish we had planned our trip to stay longer at this hotel.

One negative - we ate at Walliser Stube and the service was beyond slow and not very friendly.  Dinner took over 2.5 hours and the food was not that great.   Skip this restaurant and try another one in the hotel instead.",9/28/23

Especially the fruits and fruit juices! They don't offer an airport shuttle and most of the transfer services from the airport goto Miraflores hence taking an Uber is the best option. Lima is a very safe and vibrant city and taking an Uber very late at night is not a problem. Depending on time of day it can take unto an hour to get to the airport from here so plan accordingly.

We were to have a view of the water ...we had a view of a large ugly rubber roof .  There was no sheet on the bed so you were forced to sleep under a heavy comforter so you flipped from hot to cold all night.  The bathroom door was warped and didn't shut ...I forced it closed for privacy and then had a hell of a time getting it open because the handle was loose and it also didn't lock.   The entire room was very humid so everything including the rug felt damp.  There was no shower floor mat and the shower was a small square shower with no way to shave your legs and the soap and shampoo provided smelled terrible.  Forget about eating here as it was ridiculously expensive....2 pancakes with nothing else were $25.   On top of all that and the price of the room, we had to pay $65 to park the car there.

We will never stay here again.",9/12/23

In the guest room the carpets seem well work, the couch surface well worn, the edges of furniture pieces rubbed off and dinged up.

Other guests expressed concern for the wheelchair couple waiting to check in.  Once in the room, it was effectively non functional.  It was too narrow to push the wheelchair into the room by the ends of the bed.  The path between the beds was also too narrow for a wheelchair.

They had a seat riser in the room but it fit so loosely that it was not functional.  The room had a shower stool in a tub but not a hand held shower so effectively it too effectively was not functional.   My wife cried about the almost impossible  facilities.

Main problem was with valet. I came here with an expensive car, no other options to park so I valet.
I asked the reception if they where part of the hotel at check in and they said yes. Long story short, they are contracting with triple A. 
At check out my car came back and the interior (a little piece of plastic under the sit) was broken.
First reaction from the valet... it was not me.
File a claim and of course, they can't do nothing about it.
I have no time to spend and waste arguing around the topic so all I can do is be honest and warn future travelers.
The candler hotel or triple AAA did not take any responsability for driving my car and giving in it back to me with an issue. For the notice, every time I had my car back the sit position was changed... the broken plastic part is on the rail where the seat move...

When I made the reservation several weeks in advance for a king-size bed. We got there shortly after check-in, and was told all the kings were gone. I questioned why considering I had made my reservation several weeks ahead of time. I was given the reply that the others had made their several months ahead of time. I said I should be compensated, and I was given the card of the manager. The rest of the stay was OK, at best.

There were cars that would sit right outside the hotel and blast music.  When I called the front desk they said since it wasn’t in the hotel there was nothing they could do.  When I asked if they could call the police, I was told they didn’t know where it was coming from when it was extremely obvious.

The pool was very cloudy and there were only 10 lounge chairs for an almost 700 room hotel.  People would come out and save the chairs so there ended up being no place to sit.

Our room needed some serious work.  The curtains were broken and did not slide so they did not close all the way.  After being kept up half the night it made it difficult to sleep in.  The cold water came out hot so we couldn’t cool down the shower after the hot New Orleans days.  There was very limited drawer space for our clothes.

Our 4 year old really enjoyed the big button to open the front door, however, we were not as amused. While the  shower was very accommodating for someone who might need to be seated, I found it to be very challenging for my 6 ft body. We had plenty of lotion, shower gel, and conditioner but no shampoo which was surprising considering the bottles are attached to the wall. We were provided 2 bath towels, 1 hand towel and 1 wash cloth (there was three in my party.) We were told housekeeping would bring more up but they never arrived.

My massage was 80 minutes. Taquita is a wonderful massage therapist, with “golden” hands, exactly the right balance of soft, gentle, and very strong. These are hands that should be insured by Lloyds of London. 
The other staff, Karmen and others whose names I unfortunately didn’t catch, were so attentive and friendly. For example, my massage included a drink (lavender infused sparkling wine or champagne- not quite sure) and my daughters were also surprised to receive the same. 
At our tea, the nibbles were beautifully prepared and very tasty. We have some allergy issues, which were all carefully taken into account. The champagne flutes were kept generously topped up.. and there was also actual tea, a nice selection, served in lovely glass individual teapots.

The 800 Hilton customer service rep canceled my entire reservation when I told her not to and that left me with 1200 per night plus prices for my trip that was the next day… after hours of attempting to fix the situation I was left to show up with no other options at hand. The desk helped me out and although I ended up paying almost 1000 for the first night the remainder of the stay was adjusted so it wasn’t as terrible. They cared , and should be recognized.

Now after renovation,  ground floor seems brighter. 

Rachel was superb!!

Room: same issue with tub not draining, now add the sink not draining either.  Thank goodness for Clorox spray so we can clean the tub after each use, as one doesn’t know whose shower water they are sharing when the drain backs-up.

Luckily we only stayed one night.

The bathroom did not have a door! This was always as I was traveling with my son. He has no interest in seeing his parents naked when they r getting in the shower…or listening to them go to the bathroom!! There’s just a mirror  separating the bathroom area from the bedroom. 

The room was a little worn. Broken blinds/mold.

When I asked if they could call the police, I was told they didn’t know where it was coming from when it was extremely obvious.

The pool was very cloudy and there were only 10 lounge chairs for an almost 700 room hotel.  People would come out and save the chairs so there ended up being no place to sit.

Our room needed some serious work.  The curtains were broken and did not slide so they did not close all the way.  After being kept up half the night it made it difficult to sleep in.  The cold water came out hot so we couldn’t cool down the shower after the hot New Orleans days.  There was very limited drawer space for our clothes.

There are always 3-4 strange men lurking around the entrance, chain smoking and talking on the phone in foreign languages. Stayed here on two separate occasions within the same week and they were there every time I came to or left the hotel. Not the same men, but always hanging about whether 8:00am or 10:00pm. The cigarette smoke was obnoxious and I think single women would be very intimidated and uncomfortable staying at this hotel.

The carpets in all three rooms I saw were very filthy and your bare feet immediately got dirty walking on the carpet after taking a shower.

TVs are old and very small.

Toilets are very low.

Tub/Showers are very tight with a soap dish in the corner on the shower head side that you couldn’t help bump with your elbow when washing or rinsing your hair.

No maid service at all.

As this was suppose to be a family friendly property, we thought they would be accommodating for our toddler. 
My wife asked Catalina for a high chair so we can feed our toddler as we didn’t travel with one. There were plenty of high chairs from what we saw during the breakfast buffet so we didn’t think it would be a problem to use one. Catalina made it difficult and claimed that it was a liability issue for my toddler to use one while other guests can use it during the breakfast buffet. 
Please answer me this, how is it a liability issue for guests to use it during breakfast buffet but we cannot use it during lunch for our toddler in the eating area. Mind you that we didn’t ask to bring it up to our room, we only wanted to feed our toddler at their common area near the lobby.

Bathroom is also cramped. The room has a closet for hanging clothes, there were water bottles, safe, no refrigerator.

I would tolerate all this given the relatively low price for NYC. However, getting stuck in the elevator was unpleasant. We were stuck between floors. We rang the bell and the staff responded promptly and asked if this is the elevator on the right. They are aware of the problem with this elevator. They said that they are getting someone. It took 8 minutes for someone to unstuck the elevator. As we were checking out I heard someone else getting stuck in the same elevator. There are only 2 elevators. Don’t use the elevator on the right.

There is coffee in the lobby. There is a restaurant that serves breakfast. Housekeeping staff in the hallway seemed nice.

Three weeks later, after several emails to the front desk supervisor that left me with little confidence that this would be resolved, the points still have not been refunded. The last correspondence referred to this safety incident as an “inconvenience” and essentially indicated that they’d done their part and it’s not their problem that the points aren’t showing on my account.

I had called when making the reservation about transport to the cruise terminal and told we would sign up on arrival, but spots would not be a problem. This was not the case. The room key did not work and the clerk knew that, but let us take our luggage to the 5th floor. Had to come back to the desk and wait on someone to let us in our room. This meant the next morning we had to be ready and bring all luggage with us to breakfast. At breakfast, the toasters did not work and the coffee cups were all stuck together.

But here’s the problems we encountered, the room door, rm 101 wouldn’t latch unless you numerously slammed the door so roughly you thought the walls would break. Most times coming and going the dang door would latch at all.  We told the gal at the desk but luckily Joe was able to slam it with all his might to shut it. It worried me about our safety.  We couldn’t even lock the deadbolt for the night. The desk gal kindly gave us a tiny discount for that. But also the toilet handle had to be held down to make it flush.

I was very clean.  There are no elevators at this 3 level hotel. I was recognized at check-in as being a Globalist.  At this day the hotel was almost booked to capacity with several high school football teams and there was a lot of chaos and noise.  The duty mgr found a room on the ground floor at the extreme end from the lobby where it was much more quieter. Also because of my arthritis I have problems going up and down stairs so this also played a part in giving me a room on the ground floor.

926306222_674731,"This hotel was a Godsend! The staff at this hotel literally saved my husband's life.  He drove to Durand solo from Florida and got ill shortly arrival. Jillian, the housekeeper, noticed that he was ill and o brought him dinner.  Carlos, the manager, saw him staggering in the hall and kept watch on him until he was convinced that medical attention was required at which point he phoned an ambulance.  The doctors said my husband would most like have died within a few hours without medical intervention.  When I arrived, the staff were so solicitous and helpful. They made sure his vehicle was in a safe place, that my stay was comfortable and they even arranged to have someone pick me up at the Flint Airport when I flew back the following week to drive my husband's car back to FL. Jen, the general manager was amazing.

Yes, the rooms are a little outdated but extremely clean and the beds are very comfortable.  The staff is wonderful & I'll always stay there when I visit.",11/17/23

From the moment of first contact with the hotel reservation desk to checkout, everything went smoothly and professionally; all done is an exceedingly pleasant and friendly manner. 

At checkin the front desk greeted my wife and I by name and provided us with answers to all our questions.

Our room was spacious and fully equipped with all necessities and more.  The rooms are very quiet. 

We went to the pool and gym and both are very clean , modern and fully equipped for every need and guest requirement.

The onsite Chop Restaurant is very good offering a great menu. We enjoyed our dinner and had an enjoyable time. The staff were very engaging.

We will definitely be back.

I was impressed with the upkeep and security at this hotel.  Parking a bit on the high side and valet only.  Great breakfast and the personnel on staff were very kind and always willing to help if need be.  about three to four blocks from the walk of fame with several dining opportunities on that walk and some closer, Subway across the street.

896076022_21323934,"Youth sports team hotel The good: Hotel was clean and comfortable. Loved the free coffee and breakfast in the morning. Bed was very comfortable. Location to the city was great. 

The bad: This hotel markets towards youth sports teams staying. We had 5 baseball teams and their families. We had early mornings and had went to bed at 10:00. But the baseball kids were running the halls and in between rooms until very late. For the 2nd night I asked if I could be moved to a floor without a baseball team on it. And all 8 floors had teams. It would be really nice if they could keep one or two floors team free for people who wanted quiet. There was another lady at the front desk when I was there with the same problem. She was on a different floor and had the same situation. She was told she could come back later and speak to the event manager. 

I would recommend only staying here if you are a deep sleeper or if you call ahead and ask if they have team events staying. You should also know the train makes a U shape around the hotel. And it blows its horn right outside the window around 12 am and 6 am. Of course this is nothing the hotel can control, just good to know !",6/20/23

The cost is reasonable and includes parking and breakfast. Speaking of breakfast, Marcia does a great job. My wife and I have stayed in several 5* resorts recently. Her crispy bacon was better than any of them. Her potatoes and eggs were very good as well. She even took the time to make me a perfect golden waffle with the hotel waffle maker. It was delicious. Traffic caused a severe shuttle delay Friday night. I don’t know how he did it, but my driver kept me from missing my plane.

The beach is beautiful.  The lounges/palapa at the pool and beach could be reserved in advance for a fee or some are complementary this gives you a piece of mind that you have a spot and don’t have to get up at 5 am to reserve one.  The staff is extremely friendly and helpful.  

My only negatives/disappointment’s are:  -Breakfast buffet was a not worth the money with options offered.  We found Dushi Bagels to be a lot cheaper and better food. 
-The towel hut on the beach takes forever to get the reserved palapa situated. 
-Ruinas Del Mar didn’t impress.  For the money you pay you can find much better options.  The only highlight is the bread and ambiance.  
- Fo those traveling with kids wish they had reg rooms w/ king size beds and pull out vs. having to get a suite.  
- wish there was some entertainment at  night.",10/10/23

Most of the hotel staff was friendly, except for one front desk worker who seemed frustrated and not very warm or helpful. The rest of the staff smiled and was very attentive. For the most part room was clean except for the roach in the bathroom, so that caused me to question moving hotels. I spent 20 minutes trying to locate and exterminate it. I was then on edge for the rest of the stay. Food from the restaurant in the evenings was good and prompt. The breakfast was not! The serving area was messy and unkept. Flatware and styrofoam plates were unexpected for this caliber of hotel. Also, food would run out and guest had to wait until more was made. Valet staff were initially nice until I pointed out they severely scratched the wheels of my brand new luxury vehicle that I ordered shipped inspected just before the trip and had for less than 24 hours.

Turns out they do not offer room service. When I called the front desk they told me I’d have to leave my baby, or take him with me but he was crying, up to get food. When I asked if they could let someone from DoorDash up to the elevator because I’m not leaving my child nor am I disturbing other guests, they also said no. So there I am, upset baby, I’m hungry as hell and unable to get any food brought to the room which is unfortunate at night indeed but even more upsetting in the morning, especially as a mom traveling with a tiny one.

No fresh cut up fruit or fresh oatmeal like you see in other Marriott properties. The parking options on the Marriott app were a bit deceptive as it listed off-site parking for $4 a day and I could not find any lots nearby for that price.  And the gentleman at the front desk had no idea about off site parking options.  Parking at the hotel was $17 a day with limited space available.

Staff could have smiled more and been more inviting. Check in and check out was easy. The breakfast buffet was over priced for th food quality and service. It was a buffet and a lot of items were missing and the wait to replenish them was long. For being part of a known hotel chain, this particular Wyndham felt like a very low quality hostel stay.

When we arrived at the Marriott, the idea of not having a beach was a little concerning. After the first day of beautiful blue water, we no longer cared about the missing beach. The view from the lounge chairs was all we needed. The Marriott staff was very pleasant throughout the entire trip! Our only complaint we could offer, was the staff of the Lobby Bar. We had to wait far too long to get a drink because the bartenders were too busy making their drinks into Art Projects. We were able to eat at a different Restaurant every night by hopping on and off the City Bus (van) during out 7 night stay.

There was NO manager on duty on a weeknight around 9pm and certainly no medic or first aid.  The apple does not fall from the tree because when I notified the GM he wanted me to call him international and never bothered to call me.  No compensation for her broken wrist, nothing whatsoever which I find for a Four Seasons to be appalling.

I realised this a couple of days later when looking at my banking app. I called for this to be sorted out. The receptionist I spoke to said that I was a liar and that I had not been charged twice and cut off my call. I tried to ring back several times but no answer. In the end I had to drive back to the hotel before my flight home and physically show them my bank statement.  At that point they said that I had been overcharged. No apology the reception manager refunded my card. I asked for a full refund given the appalling treatment i had received. She gave me a 10% discount. I was told that there was no complaints policy. I have contacted Best Western twice by email to lodge a complaint- no response. Shocking !!!,11/7/23

We hauled all of our luggage back down to the lobby and they assigned us a new room. Arriving to the room we were disappointed that it was not the room that we requested.

Everything is so old, stained, torn that even though it was fairly clean it didn’t seem it.

Be prepared that athletic teams stay here, so breakfast and amenities (like the fitness center) may be taken over.  There weren't any issues with noise, thankfully.

The breakfast was just OK - I've had better at other Holiday Inn Express properties we've stayed at.  There hot water dispenser was broken, yet they had it out?  Why?

I was appreciative of the great check-out experience.  Check-in was another story, however.  When I got to my room, the front desk clerk called up, saying I had ""dropped"" my drivers license and credit card.  Nope, didn't ""drop"" it - the clerk forgot to give it to me after processing it (and I didn't ask).  But just be straightforward...there's no way that three people in my party didn't hear/see me dropping plastic on ceramic tile in the lobby.  That was disappointing...just be honest...

Right after I made the reservation, I called to check if they offer a late checkout until 3. They said Yes. Upon check-in, I made the same request, and I was told that a request has been put in the system.
 
When I called in the next morning, a very adamant front desk person called Brent advised me that the latest checkout could only be at 1 PM. After a lot of back and forth, I asked to speak to a manager. They said that the manager would call me. No one did. I received a text after 12 noon, indicating that the latest the manager could do was 2 PM. I have never spent so much time at any hotel negotiating for a 2 PM checkout.
 
I had ordered a Citrus Salmon bowl, but it did not resemble the description of the dish in the menu. I had provided the hotel the feedback, (see attached) but did not hear anything back.
 
Also, they charged me for parking, when I did not even have a car. I had to go the front desk to get it corrected.

The back window had also been smashed, and items from my glove box and center console taken. We didn’t even know it had happened until we arrived back to travel home.

For future reference, fuse box was behind a bedroom door. 

The breakfast area was spacious and the crew worked steadily to keep everything stocked. It was a mix of Bengal & Bills fans so that was fun. 

We walked to Paycor Stadium for the game and that worked fine for us. It is a few blocks walk to catch the shuttle to Findlay Market. We had beautiful weather so it was a pleasure to be outside.

The reason for the low room rating was,  I am in a wheelchair and would not recommend a handicap person staying here.  There was carpet in the room that I could not move around on.  The shower is not accessible for most handicap people. There is a step into the shower and glass doors. It is a small shower with a seat so if you are able to walk in it might work but if not it won't. The bathroom does has lots of room to move around and a high toilet and bar.",9/18/23

The location was amazing, having a kitchen was so helpful, and the shuttle made getting to the hospital and back better in the cold (Shelley and Eric were wonderful drivers!). At the hotel itself, Linda and Sophia at the front desk were welcoming and so helpful when we had questions or concerns. And the breakfast and social hour provided tasty and needed nourishment. Ms. Sharon was wonderful in the kitchen and as a support system to us and many other people staying at the hotel. Our two weeks there were tough, but staying at Staybridge made it easier.",2/22/23

Negatives outweighed the pluses however and we felt like we were in an old, inexpensive chain  motel. The electrical  outlets were all loose and chargers kept falling out; bed pillows were horrible (small, hard and lumpy); electrical outlet on only one side of bed; “room service” was takeout in a box. The concierge was not available on Wednesday, our first day,  when we needed that service most and the only toiletries were shampoo and shower gel…no lotion. One of the major networks was not available “due to contract negotiations”…what?? 

We have traveled extensively and this hotel did not live up to its description.  Will pick another hotel our next trip to Seattle.",6/2/23

The front desk staff were nice enough to warn us of the music from the rooftop dance club and suggest that we move from our 11th floor reservation down to the 9th floor. However, the music was still loud enough to keep us awake (mainly the bass frequencies). The club is loudest from 1am - 4am. Suggest staying on a lower floor if you’re sensitive to noise or a light sleeper … u less you’re a night owl in which case it won’t matter! We were traveling with a toddler so it wasn’t ideal.

I told them I would book 3 nights the following week at that hotel.  In each case it required 2 reservations because of the break in the middle.   Both the booking company and I spoke directly with the hotel and they would not allow the reservation to apply to the following week even though there was no way I could get to California.

But, for the price they charge, the service is AWFUL.

It seems like a blatant cash grab.

I reached out to Amex's Fine Hotel & Resorts Program leadership with particular ways Oceana doesn't conform to their policies and asked that they be removed from the program. An example is that the ""free breakfast for 2"" which is included with all stays wouldn't allow you to buy an actual breakfast and coffee for 2 people without being charged nearly $40 on top of your credit. A $40 breakfast is not a free breakfast.

This kind of nickel and timing of customers that seems to be the business model here. 

I'm guessing this is the same reason they are understaffed. They'd rather just pocket the money than provide the level of service that anyone would expect when paying nearly a thousand dollars a night for a room.

It is completely unacceptable and I do not plan on returning.,9/30/23

The lobby and bar were beautifully decorated, their drinks were delicious, and I loved the vibe. My bedroom was comfortable and clean.

I finally was able to speak to the Manager on the second day and he was apologetic and helped resolve the issues. The room was big, but the bed is low as the mattress is placed directly on a wood platform and not more than a foot off the floor.

Pretty quiet overall and nice breakfast options.  Strong internet too.

Only detractors were housekeeping didn't seem to do much and definitely didn't replenish the coffee and creamer any day of our stay and the laundry room was really tucked away and not obvious to find.

The next day housekeeping didn’t show up at all so we ended up using dirty towels.  We went to the front desk that night to ask for towels and toilet paper so we would have for the next day.  The following morning housekeeping showed up early again.  The room had no iron.  We had to go to the front desk 3 times before we were able to get an iron.  Breakfast consisted of coffee, sugar and carbs.  My husband asked for a pair of scissors, and the person at the front desk told him he would have to cut what he needed for him.  He wasn’t allowed to hold a pair of scissors.  Husband was very insulted by that!  There were limited TV channels.  Internet was slow.  The toilet barely flushed.

First, the check in process was really slow and I had to repeat my information because something happened with the system.  Then I had to go down again and correct my name because I got an email with my billing info and it was wrong.

The hotel does not have a safety deposit box for the computer in the room (as most business hotels do).

I used the ""do not disturb sign"" and still got a knock on my door from housekeeping saying they were just checking.

I didn’t feel comfortable letting my daughter swim in it at all. She was extremely disappointed to say the least, we stayed on the 4th floor and the hallway had some kind of awful stench. The room also triggered me husband and I’s allergies. I was thoroughly disappointed with my stay considering the fact that it is under the Marriott Bonvoy umbrella.

Also, we did not have housekeeping come, they said you suppose to request it daily but this was not shared with me. When I checked in on the app, it asked if we wanted housekeeping and I selected yes.

The lobby floor constantly has blowers running as kids run thru the lobby soaking wet which is a safety hazard especially if someone who has mobility issues. The staff was professional.
The room has a nice set up but the furniture looks nice but could use some new cushions. I did not expect to fall thru  sitting on the sofa. The kitchenette is good and has everything you need in a kitchen except paper towels.  The bedroom is good but the rug is filthy as is the sitting room rug. 
The bathroom vanity is too high and the whirlpool tub is disgusting.  It's slippery and you can see scum and filth on the jets.  It also is not conducive to short or older people who cannot get their legs over the sides to take a shower.

There were limited room options but it was the parking situation that really made this a less than stellar stay. There was limited parking anywhere but a delivery truck blocked part of the parking too -- making it impossible to come and go from the spaces.

The room across from ours had three small yapping dogs. There should be a limit to the number of pets per room as they were out of control all night.

The room was suite large sized but with a very, very small bathroom. The toilet was low and with no room, difficult to use.

The floor was uneven so walking across the carpet was unsteady while carrying luggage, or really, any items.

It’s well passed 11p and they’re still allowing them to get drunk outside!   

No wonder why your staff was on a picket line in the front protesting bc you have no boundaries.  

The hotel’s resolve was to offer me another room at 11p.  Really?  Who is repacking to move bc people don’t know how to follow or enforce rules.

Stacy at the front desk was very sweet when we explained the reason for our stay and was willing to go above and beyond for us. She offered her condolences when she didn’t have to and that’s what will keep us coming back to NYLO. Let’s just hope the next stay is on a much lighter tone.

The bed was very clean and neatly presented. I’ve worked in hotels before so when I travel I inspect the room myself and it passed all my tests. I felt safe with my car being there. The room was priced well also. I would could back to stay again & trust Sebastian with my stay. You can tell he’s a person who loves his job, this job just isn’t a pay check to him. It’s a life style that he wants to peruse. He takes care of his guest. 

Thanks again",11/27/22

Room was as expected with only one issue with temperature control but maintenance came quickly to resolve. Only complaint is the front desk isn’t able to coordinate any golf tee times or spa treatments, they largely leave it to you to reach out to both yourself. Spa books up early which we didn’t know and they didn’t reach out early enough in advance to remind us to book. These are the only improvements we noticed.",5/9/23

Service was great from top to bottom, the area around the hotel felt very safe even though it was a bit of a drive to get to the “tourist” part of San Diego.

The only downside was the tub and shower. The water pressure was quite low and the tub didn't drain very well. Also the water temperature shifted a lot during our showers. From barely warm enough to extremely hot.  

The location of the hotel is great. There were a number of bars, restaurants, and coffee shops within walking distance. We felt very safe walking around the hotel at night. 

Overall, this is a hotel we would definitely stay at again if we come back to Buffalo.",8/21/23

Plenty of parking. Far enough off the main drag to not be vehicle noisy, but close enough for easy access. Super easy and quick check in. Haven’t had breakfast yet, that’s tomorrow morning, but I’m guessing it’ll be fine. Bathroom also super clean, plenty big, great shower! This place has obviously been very well maintained.

Ben, the shuttle driver, was so accommodating and helpful in getting us around the area. He helped give us great recommendations and gave us his number to call when we needed a return ride.

The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful.  They gave us all kinds of great info with a big smile on their faces.  

The hotel offered free breakfast.  It included hot foods, cereals and bagels.  It was stocked and fresh when we were there. 

Parking was free (which is not the norm in Nashville) and plentiful.  They also offered free shuttle to Broadway which was great.    Of course you have your people who walks out and jumps on the shuttle before those standing in line but that is not the hotels fault.  The shuttle runs from 9-9 on the half hour.

What I did not like is that at check in, the guy checking me in told me that this room came with a $75 credit. He then said, well you can only use $25 per day. We were staying two nights so I was a bit surprised but that's what he told me. So, I used the credit each day and spent more money too on breakfast and on dinner. When I checked out, they only credited $50 and the girl said that's all it was because we stayed two nights, not 3. I told her that was not what I was told upon check in. (I did not solicit this because I didn't even know about it). She told me, well the guy was new. I don't think that should be an excuse. I responded to a survey from the hotel but never heard from anyone. So...just be careful that you check what they are telling you.",12/8/23

Upon checking in, the front desk clerk encouraged us to have some breakfast. It was amazing after an 8 hour flight. Lots of good hot and cold breakfast options.  The hot tub seems to be permanently closed, which was a bummer.

They are easy to find when we travel, and it’s been very rare that I’ve given a poor review. But Hampton and Hiltons have gone pet friendly, which has ruined it. I’ve had employees tell me that it is tearing up the rooms, and that it is ruining stays for many. The Hilton chains are not setting aside a wing, a floor, or even a few rooms as off limits to pets.  During our stay in Frankfort, the sofa was covered in short white dog hair, which covered my husband‘s dark slacks. The desk did nothing about it, and couldn’t even offer a lint brush. Pets are special, but many people have allergies, and most people don’t care for hearing dogs barking or leaving messes and dander in the rooms. Last I checked, pets don’t book or pay for rooms.

Rattled, I inquired about the identity of the person immediately upon entering the hotel and the person was identified as an employee of the hotel! The explanation, even before the employee was confronted by staff, was that he mistakenly took us as his ride share. Our Maserati with out of state plates is not part of any ride sharing company and therefore would not have been described as the pick up vehicle. Part of the staff appeared to be remorseful about the incident. I completed the online survey and later interacted with a person identified as part of management.

923544204_84078,"Capitol Mediocrity Other than its fortunate location, this is one of the most consistently disappointing hotels in the country and certainly the worst Hyatt I’ve experienced. Check in is always perfunctory and there is zero followup during the stay. It is common to be placed into an inferior room, of which there are quite a few. If you are put in 264 or 266, or in the equivalent rooms on any floor, you have every right to feel the front desk is punishing you. No bottled water is provided in the rooms and the tap water reeks of chlorine. On this visit housekeeping was not provided on my third day and I was told by staff that I was “not eligible” for clean glasses, towels or sheets. I informed the front desk and they said that wasn’t true but did nothing to rectify the customer service failure. Adding insult to injury, I am a Gold Member in World of Hyatt and my local employer has a corporate contract with the hotel.",10/29/23
908922206_87674,Priceline is not transparent Priceline is less transparent than other booking sites.  It was not mentioned that there would be a $15 parking charge.  Also the taxes where higher than expected.  I paid about $120 plus $20 taxes plus $15 to park my car.  I was surprised at the $15 charges since i do not remember seeing it.  So later that night I went back to Priceline.  The charge for mu room was $106 but a $30 tax and no mention of a $15 charge to park my car.  I will never use Price line again and I will try to post this above reasoning on TripAdvisor.,8/8/23

918610510_87813,"Decent hotel I like this hotel a lot. It’s my go-to when I’m in the area. Is in the area I need to be, usually quiet rooms, free parking. They clean the room if requested during a multi night stay. Parking is free, location is safe. 

My biggest complaints are that the temp controls in the room don’t really do anything (I’ve stayed multiple stays recently, this is true for all rooms/stays), with maintenance excuses about floor level, distance from main ventilation.

This Westin has moved to an allergen free room, which means no down pillows. The last 2 stays at this location, have asked for something thinner, and have been told there is nothing. An upscale hotel should at least have options for thin versus thick. While I would prefer the down, this location has no options. 

I’d thought I’d found my go-to location. Will look at other options on my next trip this way.",9/26/23
881700117_115185,"Rooms have lost their luster Is it been 20 years since I last visited, and I can tell you that the property felt 20 years older. There is still a beautiful pool and promenade out to the beach, but the elevators were old and creaky, the rooms were small, the air conditioning barely worked, the lighting was dim, the fan had one speed - slow and my room was not cleaned to the level one would expect (e.g., half used bar of soap by the sink in the bathroom, sand on the floor from previous occupant).

What was more disappointing is the level of service by the front desk staff. Incredibly unaccommodating - I asked to switch rooms when my air conditioning was not working, and rather than accommodate the request, he simply said that in my class, if there was nothing else available, and he could send maintenance to take a look at it. As another example, this morning when I asked for coffee, he told me that there was some in my room and I could get some in the restaurant when it opened.  Fortunately, I walked outside and found a wonderful coffee shop across the street – would have thought that might have been his suggestion.",3/10/23

I am currently getting dressed that time. It is an awkward situation and when addressed at frontdesk, I was told that it is language barrier since she is not fluent in english. Another incident was when we got off the elevator to parking lot. The floor was being mopped and it is still wet, but there is no sign to let the guests know that it is slippery. We are in hurry, and we did not notice that the floor is wet. I slipped! Thankfully I was able to keep my balance. It is a safety issue and I hope they will find a solution to avoid such incident.

The 800 Hilton customer service rep canceled my entire reservation when I told her not to and that left me with 1200 per night plus prices for my trip that was the next day… after hours of attempting to fix the situation I was left to show up with no other options at hand. The desk helped me out and although I ended up paying almost 1000 for the first night the remainder of the stay was adjusted so it wasn’t as terrible. They cared , and should be recognized.

Pros:
Newer rooms with very comfortable beds.
Complimentary breakfast is hot and had some good choices.  The staff in the breakfast area works quickly and are very helpful.  They even leave out coffee so I was able to get a cup in the afternoon.  This is a big bonus when traveling with children!
The gym is 24 hours.
The business center is easy to use as I had some things to print for work.
Feels like a safe location.
Downstairs by the front desk there are food and beverages for purchase and they are very reasonably priced.
Great location to food , shopping, and the highway.  There’s a Walmart next door and served us well when we needed cold meds and tea during our stay.

899702375_217341,"This hotel is awful. Do not stay at this hotel. This is definitely the worst hotel experience I have ever had in my life. Every carpet I stepped on had some sort of questionable stain in it. I understand that sometimes cleaning products (bleach) spills but I am confident every stain was indeed not bleach. In the bathtub/shower there were stains of urine on the shower wall (I am confident this was present upon arrival and from a previous guest). There were also drain flies buzzing around the bathroom sink and therefore the room. I felt obligated to wear shoes inside the room of course. I was very uncomfortable sleeping and bathing because the towels and sheets didn't smell or feel clean. Additionally, I took two cold showers because the hot water was not available. And when I wanted to rest up at the end of the day - the TV did not function.
The staff were very pleasant though.
Additionally, I am surprised how much they charged per night considering my living conditions for a few days. I made it my mission to be in the room as little as possible.

We tried multiple times to lock it, but it continued to open without a keycard. We thought about reporting this to the office, but had family members staying in the same motel with far worse rooms, so we did not want to risk a worse room. We just kept our valuables in our vehicle until departure. We did find that when we would return from being gone for long periods, it had eventually locked. Unsure how long the delay is, but someone could easily slip in behind you before it locks. There also appeared to be non-guests swimming in the swimming pool most of the time.

senior citizens for a stay on June 15, 2023. Arriving at this Hampton Hotel at 7:30pm. after traveling for 12 hours, we  were ready for a restful stay. The manager informed our tour guide that our contracted rooms had been given away to other people claiming they were avoiding a tornado that had touched down 20 miles from hotels area. We had to relocate to another hotel  at the last minute. This hotel failed to contact our tour guide about this change beforehand. What hotel does that to a pre booked bus trip that had a contract? The others seeking shelter should have been directed to the hotel we had to search out.

I used to stay at this property about 7 years ago, but the change in management or whatever they did is clearly not the same. Not sure where to start, but here's a running checklist.  Be aware they charge a $60 'resort' fee.  For what I have no clue.  Especially because the restaurant was closed for renovation and instead they had a coffee cart set up in the morning and a bar in the evening. Had I known there was no onsite restaurant, I never would have booked this property.  Also, if you're intending to work, good luck.  The wi-fi was very-very intermittent and I had to have their IT team assist three times.  Even the more 'secure' network was lame.  One of the robes in the closet had nasty stains on it, and a pillowcase also had a strange stain.  I did enjoy the live music in the lobby that they had in the early evenings.  All-in-all it was clearly not worth the price I paid.",5/17/23

Our first room on the 3rd floor had a continuously barking dog - when we brought it to her attention she was not apologetic but just said “we are a pet friendly hotel” and moved us to another room of equal value on the 2nd floor. The 2nd floor had a strong odor like ammonia or cleaning products, but we didn’t want to move again so we made due. 

The shower had barely any water pressure and took a long time to get hot. 

On the plus side the night shift desk person was an older gentleman woo was very kind and helpful. Also the bartender with the long, glossy dark hair made us the best Gin and tonic we had ever had.

The fridge in the room was old and extremely noisy, we had to unplug it to be able to sleep. 
On the positive it was the comfiest bed I had slept in, in 3 weeks in the US. There is HBO so you can watch TV without the endless adverts. The breakfast was good for American standards. You can have room cleaning if you ask for it, this is not a flashy hotel, but it was clean and comfy and that's all I really needed. Would stay here again. I would say that this is the 3rd time I've been to NOLA and it seems to have suffered/become a lot more dodgy since Covid.

The hotel is in a great location, close to everything downtown and quick to get to off the highway

The best thing about this hotel is the reception and customer service. I’ve never had such great service from all staff. 

Parking was right beside the main entrance and was an extra fee but easy to access with in and out access every day. 

Breakfast was included with our plan - the fruit, pastries and yogurt was great. The eggs and other food in the chafing dishes were never even warm. So we just stuck to the pastries 

We were in room 1401 - a one bedroom with river view. The view was amazing. The room was HUGE and had everything we needed. We loved the full size fridge. We NEVER had issues with noise or heard any emergency vehicle sirens. Our room was very clean 

Only 2 negatives for us - there was no fan in the toilet/shower area. That would have been good for our family. 

The beds were extremely uncomfortable - we definitely looked forward to being home in our own beds after the 3rd night. 

We would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to be downtown Ottawa !",5/3/23

Staff at the restaurant were fantastic.  

No bell staff or assistance with bags.

Walked into the room and the toilet wouldn't flush.  Service man tried to fix it, but said it would need more in-depth (and very odorous) work.

No offer of assistance to move rooms, just ""oh, your old keys won't work as soon as I change these.""  

Ice out of order on the floor where the new room is.

The front desk agent said no rooms were available despite multiple options showing available to book online. 2.  Waitress at the restaurant wasn’t great. Gave my two year old a glass plate after we told her no plate was needed. Was trying to juggle two kids and she impatiently barked excuse me over and over because she wanted me to pick my phone up. Asked for some berries (available on the menu) so we could give our toddler a bit of extra food. She bought a giant bowl of whole cherries. 3. My 6 year son decided to wander off after going to the washroom. We noticed right away and we were asking the reception staff for help. They looked at us blankly “your child is missing?” And then went back to typing on the computer.

Room was not even dusted in a very long time. Room needs lots of maintenance and cleaning. Please check out pics to prove what I'm saying is simply not an opinion but factual.

You could hear talking in the neighboring rooms or possibly below, you could hear people going to the bathroom in other rooms, hallway sounds were as if the door wasn't even closed, etc. We were in town for a youth hockey tournament and there was also a UND/Duluth hockey game, so we paid a premium price for the rooms - especially to get a hotel with a pool for the kids.  It might have been one of the smallest pools ever and the chlorine in the pool was so strong that the kids were only in there for about 5 min each day because they were coughing so bad they couldn't stay in any longer. One of the kids even vomited afterwards from coughing so hard. The whole team had red, bloodshot eyes. The hot tub was unbearable. There was no breakfast included in the room, you had to purchase it starting at $10 for a continental breakfast. The room was clean but needed repairs - there was tiles missing in the bathroom, the paint was pealing off the ceiling, etc. If you have kids and a pool is a requirement, I would look elsewhere.",1/24/23

The hotel really needs updating and the sheets/towels were low quality and worn. The hotel is billed as a lake view, but it overlooks a highway and the lake is far off in the distance. The toilet didn't flush well and the frig cabinet door scraped the floor when opened. We had just come from a BW at the Grand canyon that was very well kept up and had an extremely comfortable room.

As soon as I walked into my room (129) I saw hit in the face with the smell of a plugin airwhick air freshener. SUPER toxic and gives me headaches. Had to wrap it in a towel and throw it in a drawer to survive two nights. My toilet leaked into the trashcan for two days. I had to empty it several times so it wouldn’t flood my room. The tub was slow to drain during showers. The only working ice machine was on the 4th floor. The hairdryer was rusty af and of course didn’t work. Someone punched a hole in neighbors (127) bathroom door and the front desk just put them in that room like it was NBD and said “that’s all we have”.,3/19/23

The 'hotel' is some way outside Jasper... and our room was in a lodge some way from the reception. We were only staying one night so this was not ideal and spent too much time walking over and back (you can telephone for a shuttle service but can this really be called a hotel?) It's not like anywhere else I ever stayed and it did not feel in any way a luxury experience. The room was not generous though the bathroom was newly refurbished. In our room anyone over six feet would need knee protection though, as the toilet was squeezed into an alcove.

Our stay was an Executive King, which has a separate lounge.  We were informed there is planned an upgrade of rooms and amenities, which will make this more the ""Go To"" Hotel in the area.

Most of all the Front Office staff were just wonderful.  They sorted out any minor issues we had, in a prompt, friendly and professional manner.  Congratulations to all of them.

Again - Spend the extra money for a reputable hotel brand.

The  rooms are under construction and they are charging full rates! We had to stick a towel under the room door to make sure no rodents or otherwise would crawl in. They  removed all the baseboards exposing the aging underbelly of the building. The process of removing the wallpaper is underway but they should have just left it up until they were ready to install the new wallpaper. Not to mention the walls are paper thin so you can hear everything! When asked if we could be moved to another room that was not under construction they said they had none available.

I will never ever ever stay at a Ramada again. Marriott would never have a property in this condition!

We were told that long term guests had to request daily service at the front desk, which we did, but returned every day to it not being done. All we wanted was fresh towels, the garbage emptied, & the beds made. Overall, we will stay here again, as it is a very well located, clean, & welcoming property.

Tropicana needs to tell Ticketmaster to put a notation when you’re buying the ticket that it’s only first come first serve for the VIP section. They said they did that but when I went back, there is no notation of that. You think you’re getting that row and seat number which is also documented on your tickets. Very deceiving and very disappointing. So if you get tickets for the VIP section, make sure you get there early, so you end up getting the seat that you really want.",9/27/23
876247654_84482,"Tired and Dated Property Super disappointed with this place. Ownership has clearly deferred maintenance and updates. Unhelpful staff bordering on rude. Specific issues with room: door had obviously been broken into but not repaired, carpet was filthy, dirty baseboards throughout, filthy window and glass railing on balcony, bloodstain, stained and badly worn furniture. A/C was super loud, was told “that’s just how it is.” (I took filter out myself by second night which was what was causing loud rattling.) King-sized bed had tiny pillows the size of throw pillows. (King bed should have king pillows!) Scraped and peeling paint everywhere. Even though I’m a Hilton Diamond, had to essentially beg for a late checkout. ONLY redeeming quality was a nice view. For nearly $450/night (which included taxes and resort charge) this place was a huge bummer.",1/24/23

The mattresses must’ve been at least 25 years old. It was like the kind of mattress you’d have in the hotel you were spending $50 a night on. But this is a hotel costing more than $900 per night.

The TV didn't work, the coffee maker didn't work. Only one wash cloth was provided and if you wanted to plug in more than one device you were out of luck. We used the valet parking but found this isnt available between 10pm and 7am so $51 seemed steep for only half the service, as we had to check out at 4.30am. We raised all these issues on checking out, but it fell on deaf ears with no interest shown by reception. They gave us a $25 discount on the valet parking but that was it. They showed no interest in the issues with our room, just didnt acknowledge them. Poor customer service and certainly not a service I'd expect from a well known brand such as this or indeed in America. Poor value for money - it was expensive.  Maybe its because people only stay one night as its close to the airport. In any case, they need to raise their standards. Won't be returning.",9/27/23

Yes, it is a historical building so it is going to have its imperfections. However, the room was massive! Two separate rooms, one with two queen beds and the other with a living room with wet bar, fridge, and microwave. Both had flat screens as well. The bath room was clean as well as the bedding. The carpet did have some imperfections and there was a musty odor, but it was nothing we didn’t get use to. The gentlemen in the hotel bar were friendly and the service was great! They even joked with us over being the away team fans. The front desk was friendly as was the security staff. It would be hard to beat the location with the metro link across the street and Enterprise Arena a block away. Plus it was walkable to union station and the arch. The views of the city were also great! It wasn’t the best hotel I’ve stayed at, but I would stay again and it doesn’t deserve the negative reviews.",2/27/23

In the shower, the bathroom was quite clean and seemed updated, but the water temperature was off.  At times, would get cold, and then go back to quite warm.  Like the AC, just very inconsistent.

Also, didn't understand the TV menu.  What showed on the TV menu, was not the channels or the shows watched.  And not sure package they subscribed to, but seemed limited, and in the days we were there, several of the channels did not appear.

Lastly...while we did like the pool, two days we went later in the day no towels available, nobody to ask, and did not look like anyone took care of chairs/towels.

They refused to move our room even to a nonocean facing.

I did find out why though… when they clean the floors they use a lint roller on a stick and roll in over the floors, no mopping or cleaning products. ( adding pic of the roller) The walls above the bed were covered in white fuzz. Again asked to be cleaned numerous times and no assistance. 
The food was not great! It lacked any flavor at all. The bar tender was so unfriendly we felt like we were bothering her. The light regularly went off while showering. Had to get out and wave my arms to get it back on.

Valet parking is a bonus in the city as the streets are narrow and parking is sparse. However, it wasn’t included in the price and came at an additional £180 on our 4 day stay. This made it all very expensive.

The amenities for a hotel of this size were poor. The pool was freezing cold and very small. It was always empty, even when the weather was bad. The ‘gym’ was probably smaller than the hotel bathroom. Very, very small indeed.

On this particular visit we used the restaurant for all three of our breakfasts. Not only was the food great but the service was exceptional. Our server was patient and clearly repeated our order back to us, refilled our coffee and on the second day, remembered exactly what we had the day before. That is good service. 

It was unfortunate that at the same time, the restaurant was filled with some folks who seemed to feel quite entitled and very rude. We observed one in particular who didn’t wait to be seated (despite the clear signage) and in less that 30 seconds had already started asking for the manager because she didn’t have coffee yet. While this was happening (a few times) we continued to watch the pleasant and professional service from the diverse staff.

The workers staying on-site for construction were smoking weed on the 6th floor and the elevator reeked of weed.  The GM said ""she couldn't do anything about that"".   We had to walk by a passed out patron in the middle of the hallway with a joint in his hand and a beer.  That was lovely to explain to children.   If you're thinking about staying at this hotel, go somewhere else.",9/18/23
920970402_8154349,"Worst experience ever for my family! Don’t  go! Our family stayed on the 6th floor. This resort should change their name from Hilton resort hotel to something else. 1) they don’t hold the standard that other Hilton properties do. I have been to other Hilton properties and this is the worst! 2) They only announce everything in Spanish like example the hurricane happened on October 10th. They only announce their plan in Spanish at the pool but left the  non-Spanish speakers clueless. We don’t speak Spanish but we purposely book Hilton the brand name, so hopefully the workers can communicate with us in English of what is going on during the hurricane stay. Our family end up left this hotel and booked another hotel Overall, I’m not going to this hotel next time if I visit Puerto Vallarta.",10/12/23

894719053_650476,"Extremely old and smells moldy. This is maybe the worst hotel I have stayed in. The smell is awful, the hotel is dirty, and there was no coffee maker nor hairdryer in my room. The workers were very pleasant and helpful. It’s the physical structure that is well beyond what should be offered as a hotel.",6/12/23

927521696_235286,"Best hotel we have stayed in - clean, friendly This was our first time staying at the Hyatt- very impressed with the friendliness of the staff and even the workers doing the Reno of the first and second floors- it was very quiet and peaceful. The room was clean and spacious- the beds were very comfortable- we were very impressed with the breakfast selection- the freshness of everything. We were so happy with the experience that we booked for next year and are going to plan a spring trip over for a weekend and will definitely be at this hotel. We also enjoyed the pool- very clean as well. Thank you for making our trip special- it was my mother’s 80th birthday and it was very memorable. ❤️",11/26/23
871307977_72734,"One month`s stay in Seattle: Best Western Plus Mountain View Auburn The workers are very kind and always kept smiling, especially Susan was very kind and nice. Every week, happy hour was held on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday for 2 hours. It was really happy hour with kind service and delicious food, including free beer service. If I go to Seattle again, I will use this hotel again and search for Susan.",12/10/22
908618680_6390796,"Horrible-Do NOT  Stay Here! -Cold shower. Water never warmed up even on hottest setting

-Unprofessional employees who sit outside and smoke all day and come to work wearing sweatpants 

-Dirty room-couch had white stains all over it and dirt stains too. 

-Don’t keep up with laundry. Ran out of washcloths. Don’t clean rooms upon request. Never saw a housekeeping cart in the halls in four days 

-Broken elevator and ice machine 

-Shower had pink slime and black mold in grout 

-Lady working breakfast room was not nice 

Just overall terrible hotel with bad management who is letting the hotel go to junk. Do yourself a favor and do not stay here!",8/7/23
890178420_85029,Very annoying works. The hotel and employees  are wonderful however they are doing works that causes a lot of noise from 9 am.. very annoying. In my opinion they should not offer the rooms near these floors. At the check out they were nice and offer me a discount.,5/13/23
910827171_90423,"would not recommend unless it's the last hotel available definitely choose hotels at a different location if possible. pool was not clean , was dark and Danky.  breakfast was rushed and overcooked. only fruit choices was apples and no Greek yogurt. only stay if you have nowhere else to stay",8/16/23
926799617_1477820,"Welcoming, clean and comfortable. Stayed here on November 15/23 and loved it. Greeted warmly after a long trip and room clean, well appointed, roomy and super comfortable and quiet. Ice machine around the corner, beds super comfortable with two choices of pillow softness. Breakfast in the AM was more than I expected and lots of hot foods and fresh fruits and yogurt.",11/21/23
868024897_16669455,"Stay if you want to ride and horrible service  I’ve stayed here a few times for work. It wouldn’t be my first choice of places to stay, alas work books and pays for it. 

Since my first stay in May ‘22 and each month since the staff is kinda cold and rude. Everyone looks like the hate their jobs, have people in general and would generally just not want to be there. There could be a lobby full of people and and none will greet guests, unless they know you or like you. 

Rooms are good, I love the suite set up. 

Breakfast is a decent selection, except today. It was 0805, there were maybe 15 people and there was one omelet (not one type, just one), a selection of reject cereals (Cheerios and Raisin Bran), had to ask for oatmeal, muffins and breakfast sandwiches. It was a joke.

You’re better off staying at the Hampton Inn (also a Hilton property and just around the corner).",11/11/22
913668987_95864,"Hotel awesome!  Bistro terrible! The only reason I give a 4 is because of the horrible bistro staff and food. The hotel is clean and staff was pleasant.  However today 08/29 T 8 am a young   African American woman was unfriendly, kept looking at her phone while she took my order and acted as if I was bothering her. I ordered a yogurt which when I got it. It had a granola bar barely broken up and stale and the yogurt was really sour. I was afraid to eat it  while I was driving. I recommend the hotel but don’t eat at the bistro.",8/29/23
917620762_79212,"Thinking everyone Normally I do not write reviews unless they are positive. I don't have the time for negative things. If it's that bad, I just don't return to that facility.  When you look at a business and how successful they are, not enough credit is given to the small people. Not the manager, nor the people in the back office. Yes, they deserve credit. But the front desk people are the ones dealing with the public 24 hours a day. I am one who believes the public is not always right. But, those young women at the front desk have to smile and make them feel at home. I just wanted to say thank you to Christine, Elizabeth, Claudine, Terry, May ,Itzel and Devon. I know there are others I did not name but I can't remember all the names. Thank Everyone for being so professional.",9/21/23
875762047_601503,"Poor Front Desk Service Very Rude and lacking customer service by the front desk.  Both at check-in and requesting room service which never happened.  First when I checked in, when I requested my two bottles of water (Diamond member) the fornt desk clerk acted like I was asking for the world.  NExt, after my 3rd day, I requested room service, same young lady assured me she had my room down.  I requested the prior night.  When I returned the next day after taking clients out (9pm), the room wasn't serviced and I had no towels.  When I went down to the fornt desk, she said sorry and threw towles on the front desk at me.  If this is the new Hilton Standard, I will no longer be using Hilton brand hotels.",1/20/23
